LOOKING SHERIDAN Rom: IN THE FOREGROLIND
HIS tract of land, which comprises about
five acres of ground near Chicago and
situated alongside one of the finest
drives and lakes in America, has been paid
for with voluntary contributions sent from
nearly every country on the globe; from the
former adherents of the seven great religions
--literally, "from Greenland's icy mountains
to India's coral strand."
It testifies that a new era has dawned, a
new conscience has stirred humanity, a great
dynamic power has reverberated throughout
the world whereby mankind has corne to-
gether in a bond of unity such as was never
known before.
"What is the Mashrak-el-Azkar? Literally,
the Dawning--place of Praises. It is an edifice
where peoples of different nativities: races,
colors, faiths, sects, denominations, shall meet
under one dome and adore the One God in
the same spirit of Truth. -Such an edifice
could not have been erected in past cen-
turies, but in this Glorious New Day--the
Cycle of (The Glory of God)-
"there is an emanation of the Universal Con-
sciousness which clearly indicates the dawn
of a great unity"; and the Mashrak-el-Azkar
is a11 outward expression of this Universal
Consciousness, proving the ages of darkness
have passed away and the Century of Light
has arrived.
