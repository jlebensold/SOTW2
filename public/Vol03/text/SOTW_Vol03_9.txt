TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAI-IA.
thou Star of the West! I-IE IS 
Be thou happy! Be f11011 happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long, thou shalt
become the Star of the East and shalt spread i11 every country and clirne. Thou art the first paper of the
Bahais which is organized in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are limited,
thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshalcable, become the object of the attention
of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the Covenant, in the
future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto the Waves of the sea; thy volume will increase, thy
arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will be raised and become WorlCl--Wide--and at last
thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these depend upon firm-ness, firnmess,
fiw/mess.' (Sit/1zed) Assas.

ANNO UNCEMENT:
On Wednesday evening, March 13th, the va-
rious committees from the Chicago Assembly
met with the committee from the Executive
Board of Bahai Temple Unity to perfect ar-
rangements for the season of the Mashra.k-el-
Azltar convention. The cotmmittee in charge
of the Rizwan Feast (April 27th) reported
having secured a very desirable location in the
dow11-town loop district, at 2o East Randolph
Street, in the building; east of the Masonic
Temple, Where the feast room is large and
rest rooms are in connection with it.
The Reception Committee is prepared to
meet the incoming friends at the depots and
place them in charge of the Entertainment
Committee W_hich is thoroughly posted on ho-
tel and room accomm-odatio-ns. Both commit-
tees will consider it a favor to thus serve the
friends. To add to the comfort of the visit-
ing friends, Mr. Carl Scheffler has offered
his studio as a down-town headquarters where
friends may come for information, receive their
mail and meet friends by appointment, etc.
Mr. Scheffler's studio is Room 806, Athen-
aeum Building, 59 East Van Buren Street.
Telephone, Harrison 5941.
The Music Committee is actively at work;
a chorus is rehearsing every Friday evening
under the direction of Mr. Albert R. 
The music for this year's convention will be
an inspiring feature and will aid in uplifting
the hearts and making them more receptive
to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit which
we trust will be as a Pentecostal Baptism with
Abdul-Baha in our midst. CORINNE TRUE.
