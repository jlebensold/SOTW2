STAR OF THE WEST
"We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations; that all nations shall become one in
faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men shallbe strengthened;
that diversity of religion shall cease and differences of race be annulled. S0 it shall be; these fruitless strife-s,
these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the 'Most Great Peace' shall

I.
LIGHT 
Invisible!
Immeasurable Light!
Eternal as Divinity!
Impenetrably Bright!
The living universe bows
down
And veils its face before
Thee.
All angels and archangels
bend
And happily adore Thee.
II.
Shining Spirit! Light of
light!
All-flooding, radiant beam,
Eternally proceeding
Forth from Him, the 
Supreme;
To all immensity of life,
Himself Thou art reveal--
ing;
'With Thine intensity of
light,
Himself Thou art con-
cealing.

V.
Splendor of the Space-
less! Thou,
Through l10sts of wander-
ing suns,
Dost quicken dense, mate-
rial spheres,
V\7here these dull--shining
ones
Are lords of matter, time,
and space;
Their powers from Thee
obtaining,
Obedient vassals of Thy
will,
Beneath Thy glory
Waning.
VI.
Thou art the flame of Life
itself,
The Ever-living Light,
These burn with imitative
fires
Through matter's stolid
night;
V!/ith semblance of creative
heat;

Vlforlds, moons and earth-
lings breeding;
Yet, all, in traceless paths
confined,
He is the Essence, Thou the Power,
The Glory, Majesty,
The Omnipresence. He, Unknown
And Nameless, save for Thee!
Above all height and depth is He,
In His own SELF abiding;
Through Thee all depth and height He fills.
Through Thee Creation guiding.
IV.
As light from flame, Thou art from Him;
As fragrance. from the flower;
As colors from the pris1n'd light;
As rainbow from the shower

As thought from mind; or from thought;
As deed by vision guided.
So He and Thou art only ONE.
Not dual, nor divided.
Thine ordered ways are
speeding.
VII.
The planets feel Thy quivering life
And bring forth of their kind,
All plants, and creeping things, and beasts,
And men of blind
To Thy Realities are 
In earthy dungeons dwelling,
Imprisoned deep in sense and self,
The Light Unseen repelling.
Ill.
Life of Life! Perfect Light!
Pierce through the darkening walls;
Bring forth the prisoners to Thy Day;
Remove the veiling cauls;
Create new sight, new hearts, new minds;
Reveal the l1ea"venl_v vision:
Disperse the dust~formed clouds of self;
Disclose the fields Elysian!
