TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
than Star of the West! ma Is eon!
Be thou happy! Be thou happy!- Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long, thou shalt
become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper of the
Bahais which is organized in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are limited,
thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakable, become the object of the attention
of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the Covenant, in the
future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto the waves of the sea; thy volume will increase, thy
arena. will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will be raised and become world-wide--and at last
thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these depend upon firmness, firmness,
firmness!

ANNOUNCEMENT
In the last issue of the STAR or THE WEST,
a brief announcement was made that Abdul-
Baha was then in New Hampshire and would
return to New York city the latter part of
August or the first of September; also that he
would be pleased to meet in that city any or
all of the friends throughout America before
he sailed for the Orient about the middle of
September.
It seemed needless to state that that word
caused sadness to the hearts, especially among
the friends on the Pacific coast, who anxiously
awaited his coming.
But now, another word has been received
which will cause joy and happiness is, that
after a short visit to Green Acre, Maine,
Abdul--Baha will go to Malden, Mass, for a
few days, and there prepare for a journey to
the Pacific coast, visiting Montreal, Canada,
and other cities en route. The Editors.
BRILLIANT 
A new book by Mirza Abul Fazl Gulpaygan,
written December 28, I911, in Syria, and pub-
lished by Abdul-Baha during his sojourn in
America. It is a scholarly answer to an oppo-
nent of the Bahai Cause, and its clear and
convincing argument should be in the minds
and hearts of every one of the friends. Pub-
lished in both English and Persian under one
cover--the Persian a fac-simile of Mii-za Abul
Fazl's handwriting; 72 pages, attractively
bound in paper, I5 cents each. Order of Miss
