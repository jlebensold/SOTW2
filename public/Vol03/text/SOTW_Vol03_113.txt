"Question-'VVe have been told to have a
temporary Mashrak-e1-Azkar.' 
those places where they have no Mashrak-e1-
Azkar they rent a home and call it by that
name. Today, the Mashrak-el-Azkar in Chi--
cago has great importance. All the Bahais
must turn their faces in that directon. 'Why is

At the Convention--Bahais in Consultation
throughout the East and the West that the
Bahais wish to build a Mashraleel-Azkar. It
has found great importance. All ears are Wait-
ing for news coming from Chicago about the
Mashrak-el-Azkar. . . . . . The matter
of the Mashrak--el~Az1-tar does not depend on
personal endeavor, it needs public endeavor.
l/Vhen in Ishkabad the believers desired to
build the Mashrak--el-Azkar, all the friends
centered their attention on that place. There
was no individuality anywhere, and thus they
were ab-le to build.'
