THE TRUMPET CALL: 
OR 
LTHOUGI-I the STAR 01-' TI-IE WEST has
A published only a portion of the Addresses
i of Abdul-Baha delivered in America, it
must be evident to many that he is talking
upon every subject necessary to the investiga-
tion and acceptance of the Reality of Religion,
both scientifically and spiritually.
That all may be alive to the truth of this
statement when reading forthcoming Addresses
in the STAR or THE WEsT--for there are many
fortl1con1ing--and realize the importance of the
matter, we respectfully direct the attention of
the friends to the following:
Previous to Abdul-Baha's recent decision to
journey to the Pacific Coast, and during his
return visit to New York City, in answer to
a question from one of the friends, he gave
the irnpression that he would not go West
again and would depart in one month for the
Orient. When it was remarked that this would
disappoint a great many people [we quote tho.
letter received by us], "he replied that he had
talked ou every subject, from the scientific as
well as basis dud that he breathed
on the souls and spirits of all the Bclhais iu
such cl way that had it been upou boue, it
would have taken ou fiesli (iheauzug, as I
understood it, that he had given really life-
gioiug spirit) dud that if their souls were uol
ou fire how, verily they were dead--just as a
tree which is riot green dud does not show
forth sighs of life though the most 
ishiug life--gio'iug rairls are pouriug dowu upon
it, aucl the fresh spriug breezes blowiug down
upou it. all this he seemed to say that he
had doue all that he could do dud now it 
upon those whom he had blessed to do the rest.
If they were uot awakened after all this, theu,
verily, they were as dead arid dried up."
THE Enrross.
