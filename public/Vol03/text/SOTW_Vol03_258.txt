4 STAR OF THE WEST

Word of God! Light, Love and Life--
Transmuted into speech!
Thou mighty Logos--come from heaven,
The Will Divine to teach!
Incarnate Gift to happy men,
Endowed with power perceiving,
With speaking tongues and listening ears,
I/Vith minds and hearts believing.
X.
Speak Thou to self-endarkened souls!
Command, "Let there be Light!"
S0 shall eternal Day appear
To end chaotic night.
The morning stars shall sing again
The anthem of creation:
The sons of Go_d shall shout for joy
With new divine elation.
XI.
Thy Word, Light, is knowledge, truth!
Thy University,
The boundless shining realms of life,
Which mirrors only Thee.
This mind of 1nine's a twinkling orb,
Toward Thy clear sun advancing:
A flickering mote of mental dust,
In Thy great splendor dancing.
XII.
Thy flame is Love, the living Firei
Thine alchemy divine
Transmutes 1nan's spirit into Life,
The Water into wine.
thy crucible, Love,
With Thee this heart is blending;
Its life outdrawn, to be reborn
From death to Life unending.

Thou Holy Light! So calmly pure
S0 penetrating, sweet;
The whole creation's living heart
Is melted in thy heat.
The souls of things turn unto Thee,
Thy radiant Love divining,
As dewdrops glisten in the dawn,
Each one a sunlet shining.
XIV.
Thou Ocean, limpid, clear,
Unstained and colorless!
All life is thine, all beauty thine,
All beings Thee confess.
As fish in_sea, I live in Thee,
All life but Thine denying.
As gnat in flame, in Thee I die
In ecstasy of dying.
XV.
Immortal Spirit! Loving Power!
Thou dost my soul enthrall.
I am in Thee, and Thou in me;
Else were I not at all.
For what I am, have been, shall be,
Is Thine, not of my earning;
A debtor I, with naught to pay,
Except Thine own, returning.
XVI.
Thou Primal Parent! Lift Thy sons
Into the heavens of Truth!
Give them new birth in realms of Light,
Grant them eternal youth,
That they may serve Thy Universe
VVitl1 wisdom, strength, perfection;
True stars and suns of Thy pure Light,
Ablaze with Thy reflection.
XVII.
As iron, glowing in the fire,
Shows glistening and more bright,
So spirits, serving Thee in love,
Are nuclei of light. 
Infilled with Thee, Fire of Life,
In Thee all self resigning;
Through space empyreal they fly,
Pure flames of glory shining.

Thou All in all! The wor-lds of worlds
Are filled with naught but Thee.
Both light and darkness, heaven and hell,
Thou art, Mystery!
Thou dost create, sustain, destroy;
Yet Thou unchanged abidest.
With seventy thousand veils of light
The INFINITE Thou hidest.
A11, \/Vondrous Light! Invisible,
Irnmeasurable Light!
Begotten of Divinity,
Impenetrably bright!
Heaven-filled, the Universe, aglow
Unveils its face before Thee.
All angels and archangels know,
And happily adore Thee.
