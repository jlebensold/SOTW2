TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
than Star of the West! HE Is 
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long, thou shalt
become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper of the
Bahais which is organized in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are limited,
thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshalcable, become the object of the attention
of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the Covenant, in the
future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto the waves of the sea; thy volume will increase, thy
arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will he raised and become world-wide--and at last
thou shalt become the first 'paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these depend upon firmness, firmness,
firmness!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.

The limited number of pages of the STAR
or THE WEST is inadequate to present the
wealth of spiritual teachings now being show-
ered upon the friends by Abdul-Baha, to say
nothing of the many incidents and photo-
graphs of interest surrounding his sojourn
in America which should also be published.
Gladly would we increase the number of pages,
but we are compelled to consider the cost of
sixteen more issues this year. We ask the
friends to be content with what has been pro~
vided.
We wish to thank all who have so kindly
sent us stenographic reports of Abdul--Baha's
utterances, items of interest and photographs
pertaining to his visit in their midst. Please
continue in this good service. We hope to
publish this excellent material in forthcon1in0'

issues.

addresses of Abdul--Bahn while at Chicago, to-
gether with an outline of the many gatherings
