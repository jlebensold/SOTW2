STAR OF THE WEST 5
our first meeting with him he wanted us to
pay him the total amount ?r extend the same
for tw-0 years. This we did not deem advis-
able, so we informed him that We would raise
the money, p-ay him, and terminate our deal-
ings with him. He did not seem to like this,
however, and agreed finally to extend the same
for one year. We thereby saved another six
hundred dollars for the Unity. These negotia-
tions are still under way, and some disposition
will have to be made of them on ]une 24,
when the mortgage is due, The committee
therefore submits this proposition to the Con-
vention for some action to be agreed upon in
raising funds for the payment of same.
We have also investigated prices placed upon
all lands lying on Linden Avenue south be-
tween Sheridan Road and the Drainage Canal.
These range in price from $35 to $40 a foo-t and
most of these parcels can be secured if immedi-
ate action is taken. We did not feel justified
in purchasing any of these properties, but sub-
mit the matter to this body for consideration.
On the opposite side of Sheridan Road, adja-
cent to Mr. Conrad's property, is a Mr. Teufel
who owns 450 feet on Sheridan Road and has
the whole piece for sale, including an elegant
brown stone building, but we did not feel that
we could use the building at present, so Mr.
Teufel has promised us that in the event of his
selling the property, he will give us the two lots
lying directly north should we so desire.
Then there is another piece of property
owned by Mr. Yost, which lies north and ad-
jacent to the piece we bought from Mr. Con-
rad and consists of about 140 feet frontage
on Sheridan Road. Several meetings have
been held with Mr. Yost, but his price is
exorbitant at present. Therefore, We have de-
cided to let this matter rest until some future
time.
The other important matter taken up by the
Convention last year was that of the Pub-lish-
ing Society. Since that tme several meetings
been formed consisting of the following mem-
bers: Mr. T110-rnton Chase, Presid-ent, Mr.
Albert H. Hall, Vice-President, Miss Mary
Lesch, Financial Secretary, Miss Gertrude
Buikema, Secretary, Mr. Roy C. Wilhelm, Mr.
Iames W. Woodworth, Mr. Albert R. Windust,
Mr. Mo-untfort Mills and Mr. Edwin W.
Woodcock. The Publishing Society was in-
debted to the extent of $1,700 and Ways and
means have been devised for clearing this de-
ficit, about one-half of the same has now been
paid. Many of the books were out of print and
funds have been and are being raised to re-
plenish this stock and at present the Publish-
ing Society is on a better basis, both financially
and otherwise, than it has been for some time,
and at present the publishing board is striving
to have copies of all the books printed and kept
in stock. This is aproject that takes time and
they hope by the next Convention to have it in
better shape than ever.
There are many things I would like to report
that I know would be 'interesting to you, but
owing to the limited. time and the many other
duties that are before us, I will now close.
Thanking you for your kind attention in be-
half of the Executive Board of the Bahai
Temple Unity, I am,
Yours in service,
Bernard M. facobsen, .S'ecretary.
