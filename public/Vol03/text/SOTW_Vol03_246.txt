BARBECUE IN HONOR OF ABDUL-BAHA.
[Photographs copyrighted 1912, Underwood Underwood, N. 
The Consul-General of Persia, Topakyan, gave a barbecue in honor of Abdul-Baha and his Persian
suite, at his delightful summer home and garden at orristown, New jersey. The journey was accom-
plished in an automobile from the home of Mr. Roy C. Wilhelm, in Englewood, through beautiful
meadows of New ]ersey, and the whole day was spent most pleasantly at the Persian consulate, which is
a building in the garden built after the old style of Persian architecture. Among the guests Were some
prominent men from New York and some society folk to interview him on all sorts of questions. He
spoke that forenoon to those persons on the advance of materialism and its evil attendants or concomitants.
The dinner was entirely Oriental in character, a barbecue a la Perse. The afternoon was devoted to visit-
ing some friends, taking of photographs, and at about 4- o'clock Abdul-Baha returned to New York city.
Dr. Ameen U. Fm-eed.
