VVEDNESDAY, MAY 1, 1912, IN TENT, IVIASI-IRAK--
EL--AZKAR Gsormns.
The delegates and friends assembled under
a tent erected upon the Mashrak-el-Azkar site
wherein Abdul-Baha addressed them concern-
ing the grounds and buildings to be erected
thereon, after which Miss Irene C. Holmes, of
New York, presented Abdul-Baha with a
golden trowel intended for use in laying the
corner stone. The foundation not being ready
for this, it was planned that the friends leave
the tent and gather together upon the spot
marking the exact centre of the grounds,
Where the trowel was used in excavating and
placing a stone--thus formally dedicating the
Mashrak-el-Azkar site. After Abdul-Baha's
departure for the city, the friends returned to
the tent and devoted the remainder of the
afternoon to speaking and suggesting plans for
future work.
It was unanimously decided that the debt on
the main tract of land be paid June 24, 1912,
and the delegates urge the same in their re-
spective assemblies.
It was suggested that a vote of thanks be
extended to the Chicago Assembly for the hos-
pitality extended to the Visitors.
