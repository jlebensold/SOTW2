our powers make an effort so that We may
establish this international auxiliary language
among the nations and races of the world.
I hope from the Bounties of God that this

among various nations of the world intelli-
gent men may be selected and organize an
International Congress, and that that Con-
gress may make its chief aim to proinote this
international language.
