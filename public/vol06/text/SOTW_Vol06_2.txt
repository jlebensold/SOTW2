 friends! In this day the door of heaven is
opened by the key of the godly Name, the ocean of
generosity is manifested and is rolling before your
faces, and the Sun of Providence is shining and gleaming.
Do not be exclusive nor destroy your most precious
time through the speech of this or that person. Gird
up the loins of endeavor and do your best in training
the people of the world. Do not imagine that the
Cause of God is a cause of opposition, hatred or wrath.
The Sun of Greatness hath said, that which is revealed
from the heaven of will in this Supreme Manifesta--
tion, is to unite the people with love and friendship
toward all. The people of Baha, who have drunk of
the pure wine of reality, must associate with all the
world with a perfect spirit of joy and fragrance, and
remind them of that which is for the benefit of all.
This is the Commandment of the wronged One to
his saints and sincere ones.
people of the earth! Make not the religion
of God a cause of variance among you. Verily of a
truth, it was revealed for the uniting of the whole
world. Blessed is he who loves the world simply for
the sal<e of the Face of' his Generous Lord. With
perfect compassion and mercy have we guided and
directed the people of the world to that whereby their
souls shall be profited. I declare by the Sun of Truth
and which hath shown forth from the highest Horizon
of' the world, that the people of Baha had not and
have not any aim save the prosperity and reformation
of the world and the purifying of the nations.
