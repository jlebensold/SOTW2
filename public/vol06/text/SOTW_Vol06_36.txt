36 STAR OF
the members of the committee lingered,
as one gathered from Dr. D'Evelyn's
words, and it was a moment, he said,
when military experience was of value,
when the habit of quiescent waiting
through long hours for the word of
command bore fruit. Those Who
waited were rewarded, for in the
wei.rd moments between two and
three in the morning, the white turban
of Abdul-Baha at last issued from the
long exit at the ferry, and his warm
hand clasp, and the welcome of his eyes

Between these two addresses many
good things were- said, Mr. Harris gave

The delightful feature of the feast
was not the brilliance of individual
speakers, nor Mr. Wilhelm's gay and
tactful manner of filling the office of
toastmaster, nor the charm of the en-
vironment provided by Mrs. Gooda1l's
genuine hospitality, though all these
were appreciated. It was perhaps sug-
gested by the few words spoken by
"Pa" Goodale. There was a warmth
and tenderness in his simple words
which found a response in every heart.
