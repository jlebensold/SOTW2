seminated upon the face of the earth.
Yet I see only Thy wronged followers
who are crying at the tops of their voices
and summoning the people:
Hasten ye toward affinity!
Hasten ye toward faithfulness!
Hasten ye toward generosity!
I-Iasten ye toward guidance!
Hasten ye toward union!
Hasten ye to behold the Light of the
World!
Hasten ye toward love and prosperity!
Hasten ye toward peace and reconcilia-
tion!
Hasten ye toward the law of disarma-
ment!
Hasten ye toward harmony and suc-
cess!
Hasten ye toward co-operation and mu-
tual help in the path of guidance!

Verily, these wronged ones do sacrifice
themselves with infinite joy and happi-
ness for the sake of the people, with all
their souls and spirits throughout all
regions. Verily, Tho-u beholdest them
weeping at the misfortunes of every one
of Thy creatures and becoming grieved
at the distress of Thy children; they are
kind to all the people and pained at the
sight of the calamities of the inhabitants
of the world. my Lord! make the
wings of prosperity to grow upon their
shoulders, so that they may ever soar
toward the apex of their aspirations;
strengthen their lo-ins in the service of
Thy people, and confirm them in the
thralldom and adoration of the threshold
of Thy Holiness.
Verily, Thou art the Merciful! Thou
art the Clement, and there is no God but
Thee, the Powerful, the Compassionate,
and the Ancient!

comes from your declaring that Jesus of
Nazareth was a great man who issued
from Israel, and we love him? A great
man indeed did we give to the world.
Such a mighty personage, whose Word
has spread throughout the world, was
an Israelite, who has conquered the
East and the West. Such a person was
born of this race. You should be proud
of him! When you your glory
and honor in the recollection of Christ,
rest assured that the Christians will
shake your hands in fellowship. There
will be no trouble therein; there will be
no hesitancy; there will be no restraint.
Consider, for this fanaticism what a lot
of trouble and what persecutions
have been heaped upon you in Russia.
And you must not think that this is all
ended! This humiliation will continue
forever! The times may come when in
Europe itself they will arise against the
Jews. But if you should declare Christ
to be the Word of God, then you will
rid yourself of all the trouble. What
harm comes to your religion if you be-
lieve in Christ? Jesus was a Hebrew.
My advice is this, that your fu-
ture may be assured and secure, that
you may become honorable, that the
Christians may love you, and all this
depends upon two words: "Christ, the
\/Vord of God!" Finished! Nothing
more! Is it not a thoughtless state"! Is
it not ignorance"! Is it not folly? Is
it not stupidity"! Get thee hence, 
prejudice! Say, "Verily the Word of
God was realized!" a.nd all will be
right.
At last, he said: guess that is so.
I believe that it is perfectly so-! But I
ask one thing more of you. Cannot you
tell the Christians to love us a little bit
more!"
I said: Very well. I have done so,
and I will continue to do so.
