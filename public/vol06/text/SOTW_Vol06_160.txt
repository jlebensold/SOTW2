turned from Alexandria with the good
news of his well being and safety, as
well as that of the friends.
My wife and family all remember you
and send you their sincere love and
greetings.
With Baliai love and greetings, your

Bombay, India, Dec. 4, 1915.
Dearest spiritual sister:
I have received two letters from you
each dearer than a world to me. Oh,
you do not know how we all here re-
member you. It was indeed very kind
of you to send us the Carnegie tablet.
We have in India two newspapers the
editors of which are very pro-Bahais
and a magazine whose editor is a Bahai.
One of the pro-Bahai editors is lV[r. B.
Temple of London, now editor of "The
Daily Gazette" at Karachi. You must
have read his lecture at the Royal So-
ciety of Arts, London, on the Movement,
in 1910.
The other who is a Bahai, is the edi-
tor of a magazine in Madras. It is called
"The New Reformer." His full name
is D. Gopal Chetty.
Now I am sure that the Carnegie tab-
let shall come back to you from India
like an echo.
It was indeed a. pleasure to read of
the many interesting things about the
friends in America, and of Carl Han-
nen, who, I think, is the son of the dear
Joseph Hannen. I shall copy your ex-
ample in future and tell you of little or
great events here.
Our brother M. R. Shirazi, who is at
Karachi, has come down for a month to
Bombay. He missed the opportunity of
meeting you, simply because Karachi is
a little out of the way. . . .
Hasmatullah has now nearly gathered
an assembly in Karachi.
THE WEST
All the sisters here are sending you
all their best wishes and prayers and
desire that you will pray for their suc-
cess.
Dear sister, if we are backward in
service compared to you, it is because in
our childhood we had not the benefit of
a good education. Now we hope that
our daughters may do better.
Yours very humbly,
Dowlat.

Cairo, Egypt, Dec. 5, 1915.
My dear Bahai sister:
Your good letters, of October 9th and
30th, were truly welcome and I have
passed them around among the friends
and read them to others. All were glad
to hear from you and receive your words
of love and re-me-mbrance. . . . All
that you wrote was interesting, concern-
ing your visits to the different assem-
blies.
This autumn I have especially been
working for the education of girls. . . .
My Bahai meetings continue with inter-
est and devotion, and we feel the power
of the Spirit with us. The chief thing
is to keep close to God and to be con-
stant in prayer, then He will be sure to
use us in His service, and always there
is something to do everywhere. It is
blessed to be used by Him to uplift souls.
Mrs. Getsinger is at present stopping
in Cairo, so we are joining our forces
in our work here and it is good to have
her here and the young Bahais are very
glad to meet her and hear her speak.
Mrs. St-annard left Cairo in the early
summer and went to Port Said, where
she has been living ever since. She
seems to prefer it to Cairo or Alexandria.
The friends all speak of you often and
all have such a sweet loving remembrance
of you. They would be so happy to see
you here again.
Yours ever, in El-Abha,
Eliaiore 2'-scox.
