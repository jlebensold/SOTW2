STAR OF THE VVEST 157
Mashrak-el-Azkar of Ishkabad. Note
the decorations he Wears. These were
received from the Russian government
in recognition of service rendered in
offices to Which he had been appointe-d.
Another picture shows the Mashrak-e1-
Azkar under construction. I send you
With him. Again, in the late spring of
1910, When Howard Struven and I Were
with Abdul-Baha, we had several
memorable visits with the venerable Af-
nan, who Was then visiting on Mount
Carmel, in the German Colony, not
far from the tomb of the Bab. I recall
The Great Afnan
also a likeness of t-he Afnan himself with
two sons, one upon either side.
In the early summer of 1908, I made
a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and
Akka. At that time it was not advisable
for a Westerner to go to the home of
Abdul-Baha, so I was entertained for
two days in Akka in the home of the
Afnan. This was my first acquaintance
him as a most patriarchial figure with
his long white beard, green turban and
the flowing robes of the orient. Though
the physical man showed his many years,
his smile was radiant-ly brilliant, giving
a glimpse into the chambers of the soul
of the inner--the real spiritual man,
which knows no age, for it lives eter-
nally.
