80 STAR OF
"Rejoice! Rejoice! The rivers of celestial
ideals are flowing from the mountains
of decree!
"Rejoice! Rejoice! The gales of love
and peace have stirred deeply the sea
of God's grace and pity!
"Rejoice! Rejoice! The music of reality
has attracted the hearts of all the sin-
cere ones!
"Rejoice! Rejoice! The trees of the gar-
dens o-f truth are bedecke-d with the
most luscious fruits.
"Rejoice! Rejoice! The Beloved of all
nations Will soon enter the assembly
of the children of men with a radiant
face!
"Rejoice! Rejoice! for the earth of capa-
bilities is already begemmed [orna-
mented] With the sweet amaranths of
love and the fragrant lilies of affec-
tion!"
In such Wise the friends must Work,
for as the moral physicians of the World
of humanity, their pharmacopoeia must
be fill-ed With all kinds of medicines;
thus they may be able to treat every
kind of illness and disease. Firm-
ness and steadfastness is the condi-
tion Whereby they may attain to this
unparalleled station. They must close
their eyes to the World and the things
contained therein. Their Work is in the
realm of the spirit; their eiforts are
along the line of morality and the incul-
cation of ethical principles. They look
at all times towards heaven and are
THE WEST
enraptured With the beauty of the Be-
loved. They are not attached to any-
thing. They pray at morn and eve for
the misguided children of men and wish
them naught but good and prosperity.
The heaven of their minds is not dark-
ened With the clouds of prejudices. nor
the chambers of their hearts bedimmed
with the smoke of hostility. They are
released from all such ties and are soar-
ing in the atmosphere of sanctity.
I am writing you this letter from the
lovely garden of Abdul-Baha. He is just
Walking amidst the beds of roses and
talking with a number of friends on the
corruptibility of nature and the sacred-
ness of the Word of God. 'Like unto the
sun, he shines upon the just and unjust.
Every day We descend from the Pilgrim 's
House and spend several hours in the
verdant garden and listen to the Words
of truth and Wisdom. They are indeed
life-giving and soul-uplifting. I wish
you Were present; but I am sure you can
accomplish better and more eflicient
Work where you are.
Abdul-Baha remembers you and sends
you his greeting. He prays for all the
friends at the Holy Threshold and the
blessed tomb of the Bab.
Give my greeting 'all the friends are all well and
happy. I anticipate the time when I
shall have the pleasure of seeing you
face to face.
I am ever your sincere brother
(Signed) Ahmad.
