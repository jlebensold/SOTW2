He, himself, Was so moved at one time
his lips trembled and he could only pro-
ceed With effort. The vibration' of his
Words, therefore, was far deeper than
anything expressed in the Words them-
selves.
All Who participated in this feast
left it with a new consciousness, a sense
of union, of Warmth and gentleness to-
Ward all, a new feeling of the need of
brotherhood in the World, and of What
LEBRATING THE FEAST OF RIZWAN
real brotherhood is. Is not this What
Abdul-Baha means when he says he
hopes the Bahais will kindle such a fire
of peace in America that they will es-
tablish the peace of the World"? Be-
cause real and lasting peace is not set-
tled by mere diplomatic legislation, but
HE 37
must spring from a new and more ten-
der feeling in the heart, Which cannot
endure the existence of suffering in the
World, and insists upon the creation of
that new justice which is not satisfied
unless each country not only makes
peace With its neighbor but sees to it
that individually its citizens are assured
of happiness and equal opportunity.
Perhaps one might call this spiritu-
ally a militant peace; it is not quiescent,
it is not pacific in one sense, because it
insists upon positive action for the es-
tablishment of truth, and upon Wide
readjustments, but such a Warm, smil-
ing, militant peace spreads from one
happy heart to another, and ensures
the happiness of the World.

On April 21st the Feast of Rizwan
was celebrated at the home of Mrs.
Helen S. Goodall in Oakland. The
friends gathered in this beautiful
spot, Where Abdul-Balia had been,
where he had addressed to the lovers
of truth, Wonderful words. These
Words were read by Mrs. Ella G.
Cooper and were the center around
which the feast revolved. Mr. Roy C.
