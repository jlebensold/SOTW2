Kitab--el-Akdas
0 concourse of creation! 0 people!
Construct homes (or houses) in the most beauti-
ful fashion possible in every city, in every land, in
the name of the Lord of Religions. Adorn them
with that which beseemeth with pictures
or paintings. Then commemorate the Lord, the
Merciful, the Clement, in spirit and fragrance.
Verily, by His mention, by this commemoration, the
breasts shall be dilated, the eyes illuminated, the
hearts gladdened, and thus shall you pray the Qrient
of' Praises in the Mashrak-el-Azkar the Source
of' Praises).
Teach your children what hath been revealed
through the Supreme Pen. Instruct them in what
hath descended from the Heaven of Greatness and
Power. Let them memorize the Tablets of the
Merciful and chant them with the most melodious
voices in the galleries built in the Temple of the
Mashrak-el-Azkar. The prayers of the Lord shall
be chanted in a manner to attract the hearts and
souls.
Blessed is he who listens unto the River of
Life
