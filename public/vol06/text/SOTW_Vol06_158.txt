Here was Aga-Seyed-Taki-Afnan
spending the evening of a long life of
service near to Abdul-Baha, on the hal-
lowed slopes of the mountain of 
that spot frequented by the Holy Seers
and Prophets of biblical days--that spot
from which now, in these latter days,
the spiritual religion of God is again
being given to the world.

simple tomb of Aga-Seyed-Taki, the Af-

The service of the great Afnan in
this world was completed in the summer

While George Latimer and I Were on
Mount Carmel a year ago last October
(1914), we took a walk one day over the
mountain, in the direction of the sea,
toward the cave of the Prophet Elijah.
Below us, on the flat between the foot of
the mountain and the shore, was the
Bahai cemetery. From where we stood,
we could look down into the small en-
closure, in the center of which is the
bology of the dove. In the past the
"dove of peace" has always been repre-
sented as soaring above the earth, but
here, even while the great war raged,
we seemed to see the dove calmly
resting upon the earth 's surface, afford-
ing the refuge, in this age, of spiritual
peace, protection and shelter!
Could the mortal Aga-Seyed-Taki, the
grea-tAfnan, have a more fitting resting
place than amid such holy surroundings'?
Faithfully yours in the service of the
Mashrak-el-Azkar,
