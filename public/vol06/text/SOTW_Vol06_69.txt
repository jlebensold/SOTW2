BELOVED of God! These days are
the time for firmness and the period
for steadfastness and constancy in the Cause
of God. You must not look upon the
personality of' Abdul-Baha, for he will
eventually bid ye farewell. Nay, ye must
observe the Word of God. If the Word
of' God is in the ascendant, be ye happy,
joyous and thankful, even if' Abdul--Baha
be "under a sword or beneath fetters and
chains; for importance is in the holy temple
of the Cause of God, and not in the physical
mould of Abdul-Baha.
The beloved of God must be confirmed
with such a firmness that if every moment
a hundred like Abdul-Baha become the
target of arrows, no change should occur
in their decesion or intention, no transfor-
mation in their zeal or attraction to God,
and no abatement in their occupation in
the service of the Cause of God.
Abdul-Baha is the servant of the Word
of' the Blessed Beauty and the manifestat-
ion of absolute servitude in the threshold
of the Lord. He has no other station, grade,
class or power. This is my utmost hope,
and my abiding paradise.
