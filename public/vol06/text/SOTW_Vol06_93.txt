STAR OF THE WEST 93
The following extracts from tablets and cablegrams sent by Abdul-Baha
to Bahais in America, explain this important matter 
Tablet revealed many years ago:
ye beloved of God! Highway robbers are many and hypocrites are
innumerable. The wolves clothe themselves with the shepherd's garment and
thieves show themselves in the form of watchmen. Hereafter, if any Persian
or Oriental come to those parts, even though he be from the very city of
Akka, if ye find he does not possess a letter written by the hand and sealed by
the seal of Abdul~Baha, you must decidedly avoid him. (Signed) ABDUL-BAHA
ABBAS.

From a tablet to Charles Mason Remey, VVashington, D. 0., translated by
Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, London, England, December 29, 1912:
Awaken the friends, for ere long a test shall come. Perchanee some per-
sons, outwardly firm and inwardly wavering, shall come to those parts in
order to weaken the faith of the friends in the Covenant of God. Let them
be awake! Let them be mindful! As long as they see a trace of violation
of the Covenant, they must hold aloof from the violator. Day and night let
them strive so that the lights of the Kingdom of Abha may encircle the globe,
and the darkness of error may be. entirely dispelled. (Signed) ABDUL-BAHA
ABBAS.
