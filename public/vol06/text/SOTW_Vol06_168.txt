168 sran or TIIE 
announcement! of the passing of one of
our friends Madame Cheron on January
20th last, in Paris.
During Abdul-Baha's visits in Paris,
souls became attracted to the Cause, and
the principles of his teachings became
known--and produced an efie-ct upon
many. Then out from these people there
arose a few who recognized the Covenant
of God and realized that in Abdul-Baha
was the living spiritual Center of this
new life in the world. Madame Cheron
Was of these few. The spiritual atmos-
phere of her home was to the hungry
and seeking soul as an oasis in the desert
to the tired traveller seeking refreshment
and rest.
During the weeks prior to the outbreak
of the War, which George Latimer and I
spent in Paris, we Went often to the
apartment of Madame Cheron, overlook-
ing the Seine. At times when sur-
rounded by discouragements we Went
there to talk about The Center of The
Covenant and thus revive our spiritual
forces; and at other times We went there
to meet groups of friends and seekers
Whom our kind hostess had gathered to
hear the wonderful story of The Cause
of God. It will interest the friends in
this country to know that the first of the
ninth-day Mashrak-el-Azkar meetings
held in Paris, was at Madame Cl1eron's
home.
Only a few Weeks before her death
Madame Cheron wrote from the Ameri-
can Hospital in Paris, saying that she
had but a few more weeks here with us-.
She had suffered much, but was happy
and co-ntented. My first thought was
that she might be spared for more spir-
itual service here, but such was not
Grod's will. cannot say that her
work is finished, for to those of us who
knew her, her faith in and devotion to
Abdul-Baha continues to inspire us-it
Will always stand out as a spiritual light
of brilliancy amid the surroundings of
darkness of material Paris.
Faithfully yours in El-Abha,
Charles Mason Remey.
MR-S. THOMAS PETERSON
1838-1916
Mrs, Thomas Peterson, who died at
the home of her daughter, Mrs. Jensen,
Burlington,
\Vis., February
13, 1916, at the
age of seventy-
seven years, was
one of the pio-
neers of the Ba-
hai Cause in
Wisconsin. She
received 
message in 1899.
It was her desire
that the Bahais
conduct the fu-
neral service. Mr. Albert R. Windiist of
Chicago and Mr. Andrew Nelson of Ra-
cine responded to this request. The se-
lections from the utterances of Baha'o'-
llah and Abdul-Baha which were read,
made all realize that the promised age
had indeed come, when "God shall Wipe
away all tears from their eyes."
