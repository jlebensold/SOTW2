IN THIS DAY every one must be tested,
as the time of the "chosen ones" to
prove their Worth is indeed very short.
The day of attainment is drawing to a
close for them. The "first fruits" must be
ripened in spirit, mellowed in love, and
consumed by their self-sacrifice and sev~
erance. None other are acceptable as first
Fruits, and all Who fail to attain to the
standard through the tests are relegated
to the "many who are called."

[The above excerpt is from notes brought by Dr. E. C. Getsinger from Haifa.
As the notes were not signed by Abdul-Baha, the responsibility for their correct-
ness must rest with Dr. Getsinger until the door of communication with Abdul-
Baha is again opened and the statements therein confirmed. Inasmuch as they
appear of vital importance to all, we publish them in this Editors]
