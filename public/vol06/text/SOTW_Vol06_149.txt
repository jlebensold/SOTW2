SITE THE MASHRAK-EL-AZKAR IN AMERICA
Last Words of Abdul-Baha concerning the Mashrak-el-Azkar
As to the matter of the building of
the Mashrak-e1~Azkar, that is, the matter
of beginning the building thereof-an
important (or considerable) sum of
money must. decidedly be prepared in
order that work may be begun: that is,
at least two or three hundred thousand
dollars must be ready. And, most as-
suredly, if it be built in the days of the
Covenant, it will be more joyful and
more heart-rejoicing; but this is diffi-
cult.
Now be ye engaged in collecting con-
tributions. [Translated June 12, 1913.]
Verily, I pray God to confirm thee
with the All-Power so that the means
may be prepared' for the establishment
of the Mashraloel-Azkar.
[Translated June 19, 1913.]
Blesseel is he who listens emote the
R-iver 0 Life aha 'o 'lla-11.
