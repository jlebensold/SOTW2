The fifth convention in Chicago, April

The sixth convention was entertained
by the friends of New York City, April
28 and 29, 1913. Regarding this Won-
derful convention Abdul-Baha Wrote Mr.
Wilhelm, saying:
"Praise be to God, that the New York
believers became confirmed in the ac-
complishment of a "great service and
held in that city the consultation con'-
vention for the erection of the Mashrak-
el-Azkar. They displayed the utmost of
effort until that convention Was inaugur-
ated with infinite perfection. They ek-
ercised the greatest of love a.nd kindness
towards all the delegates who had -come
from the different states. They united
and entertained the delegates in their
homes. With perfect affection they
spread before them the banquet of hos-
pitality. Every one became grateful
and happy. This event will adorn an
important and blessed page in the Bahai
history."
At this convention the commemora-
tion of the ninth day of -every month as
Mashrak-el-Azkar day was proposed and
afterward confirmed by Abdul-Baha and
has proved a very great impetus to the
Mashrak-el-Azkar work. The friends of
other countries join with us in observing
the day; very beautiful are the letters
from our four American sisters in Te-
heran telling of their holding this ninth
day with us.
The first contribution for the fiscal
year April 30, 1912, to April 19, 1913,
was a gift from the Center of the Cov-
enant at the closing session of the pre-
vious convention in Chicago. Also this
year marked the completion of the pay-
ment on the site dedicated by Abdul-
Baha and an indebtedness of $9,000 on
the Lake Shore tract remained only, its
entire liquidation being urged before the
expiration of 1913. The contributions
for the year having been $14,206.42.
Another year soon rolled around and
Chicago was again blest With a Mashrak-
el-Azkar convention, which was the sev-
enth convention. It also marked the
fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of
Baha 'o-'llah.
At the close of the year 1913 the money
came literally rolling in for the cancel-
lat-ion of all land debts and a cablegram
was sent to Abdul-Baha announcing that
the Bahai Temple Unity had completed
