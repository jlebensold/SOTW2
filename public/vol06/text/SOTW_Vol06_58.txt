its land obligations. Thus the new year,
1914, dawned free of any clouds for the
Mashrak-el-Azkar work so that the build-
ing fund might be started. The financial
secretary reported contributions for the
year $13,503.79 and the Unity entirely
out of debt with land holdings for which
$51,500 had been paid and which was
Worth almost double the price paid. Com-
plete unity and harmony marked the
se-ssions of this seventh convention.
And now the eighth Mashrak-el-Azkar
convention and first Bahai congress has
convened in San Francisco. Thus our
co-nventions held in the United States
of America have travelled from coast to
coast.
Almost immediately after the second
convention, when the Bahai Temple
Unity resulted, the president of the first
Executive Board, Mr. Mountford Mills,
of New York City, visited the Center of
the Covenant who was still a prisoner
of the Turkish Government, though lib-
erated in July of that same year, 1908.
Mr. Mills wrote: "At the temple con-
vention, he seemed most pleased and sat-
isfied and assured us that the future
would see many more, constantly in-
creasing in numbers, attending and
bringing together representatives from
all parts of the World. He said that these
gatherings would be to the spiritual body
of the world what the inrush of the
spirit is to the physical body of man,
quickening it to its utmost parts and in-
fusing a new light and power."
One of the most touching gifts to the
building fund was a check for $1,000
addressed to "the Bahai Temple of
Peace" and saying in the letter, "In
Europe, fathers and brothers have been
torn from their Wives and little chil-
dren, and many left at home are in Want
o-f dire necessities. Our beloved ones are
not facing mutilation, acute suffering
and death. I send this as a thanksgiv-
ing offering, though it seems minute in-
deed to express what I feel."
During the fiscal year beginning April
27, 1914, the contributions have
