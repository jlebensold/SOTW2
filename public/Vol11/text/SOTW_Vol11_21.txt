 L.-perched on the highest branches of the
tree of life, filling the air with songs
of love and happiness.
Endeavor as far as you are able to
lay the foundation of your love in the
very center of your spiritual being, in
the very heart of your consciousness,
and do not let this foundation of love
be shaken in the least.
And when God gives you sweet and
lovely children, exert yourselves in their
education and training, so that they may
become the imperishable flowers of the
divine rose-garden, the nightingales of
the ideal paradise, the servants of the
world of humanity and the fruits of
the Tree of Life.
Live ye in such a manner that others
may take your life as an example, and
may say to each other: "Look! How
they live like unto two doves in one
nest with perfect love, affinity and har-
mony. It is as though God had kneaded
from eternity the very essence of their
beings for the love of each other."
When such conditions exist and such
ideals hold sway, then you have taken
a large portion from the everlasting
life, have quaffed deeply from the
fountain of Truth, and have spent your
days i11 the paradise of glory gathering
the immortelles of divine mysteries.
Be ye to each other as heavenly lovers
and divine beloved ones. Spend your
life in the paradise of love. Build your
nest on the leafy branches of the tree
of love. Soar ye in the clear atmo-
sphere of love. Swim ye in the shoreless
sea of love. "Walk ye in the eternal rose-
garden of love. Move ye in the shining
rays of the sun of love. Be ye firm and
steadfast in the path of love. Perfume
your nostrils with the sweet fragrance
of the flowers of love. Familiarize your
ears with the soul-entrancing melodies
of love. Be ye intoxicated with the wine
of love. Drink we deeply of the elixir
of love. Let your ideals be the bouquet
of love, and your conversation the white
pearls of the ocean of love.
