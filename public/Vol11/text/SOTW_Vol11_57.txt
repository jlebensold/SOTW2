circle of its discussion must be widened; in its columns must be Published the essential prob-

versal principles of the Cause, the writers proving that this Cause takes a vital interest in
all the social and religious movements of the age and is conducive to the progress of the
world and its inhabitants. In short, the STAR or THE W1-zsr must promote the aspirations and
the ideals that will gather little by little around these general Tablets, bringing into the light
