164 STAR OF
He Is God!
thou pure leaf of the Blessed Tree!
Thy letter was received and its con-
tents noted. From lack of time a short
answer is given, for letters pour down
like unto rain from the East as well as
from the West. I have no time for a.
detailed answer. In brief it is this:
It is not permissible to hang the
sacred picture on the walls of rooms;
but to hang the Greatest Name, or the
picture of the sacred tomb, or the pic-
ture of a spot where His Holiness
has been, is permitted.
I pray to God that ye may ever be en-
kindled with the fire of the love of God,
attracted by the fragrances of God, as-
sisted in benevolent deeds, in good and
faithful conduct and firm in the Gove-
nant and Testament. Whatever thou
deemest advisable for the promulgation
of the Cause, it is acceptable.
As to the election of women, this is a
political question. I avoid all politics,
but I say this much, that men and
women are both parts o-f the human
branch, and for mankind two wings are
necessary. If either one is weak the
bird will not fly, but if both are strong
mankind will soar to the exalted sum-
mit.
Upon thee be greeting and praise!

[l\loTE--Mrs. Rice-Wray sends the above
Tablet to the STAR or THE with
the following word of explanation: 
am enclosing the copy of a Tablet re-
ceived recently and which I feel is not
intended for me but for someone who
asked the questions which it answers.
And someone may have my Tablet. Per-
haps you have heard of someone who
has a Tablet plainly not for them.
Someone surely is looking for this one."

To his honor, Mr. Edward Struven,
Beverly, Massachusetts--Upon him
be El-Abha!
He Is God!
thou who art firm in the Covenant!
Thy letter was received. Thou hast
mentioned in it the name of the attrac-
ted maid-servant of God, Lua
pertained to the Kingdom, was lordly,
was merciful and was attracted by the
divine fragrances. That blessed leaf
has been the cause of the guidance of
many a soul for she was endowed with
a. heart that was attracted, a tongue
that was eloquent and spent her time
day and night in teaching. At present
she is calling ye from the Abha King-
dom saying: ye my children! Are
ye aware of what bounty I have at-
tained"? If so, ye would cast behind
this body and would hasten and
fly to this Divine Realm." In fine, Lua
has acquired an everlasting fame and
an eternal bounty.
Thou hast written concerning the dif-
ficulties arising between Labor and Cap-
ital, ye may discuss this question at
Green Acre. When I was in America,
I delivered different addresses on that
subject; get those speeches and discuss
the topic in accordance with them.
Upon thee be El-Abha!
