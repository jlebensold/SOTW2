STAR OF THE WEST 231
the community of the friends and de-
posit like unto the snake their poison
and give false impressions. Ye should
be very watchful of this, not admitting
these souls in your meetings and assem-
blies.
Everyone who has in his hand a let-
ter of permission to associate with the
friends, Written and signed by Abdul-
Baha, ye may associate with him, else ye
should avoid and abstain. No individual
of ye is permitted to associate with them
because the diseases of the spirit are like
unto the diseases of the body and like
unto plague, cholera and cancer Will
infest.
Ye should be in the utmost union and
liarmony with the formal community
of the friends, that is the "Bahai Bund"
and communicate with it with love so
that in Germany there may exist but
one ardor, one feeling, one attachment
and union in order that this may pene-
trate throughout the World.
Upon thee be Baha-Elhbha!
(Signed) ABBAS.

Ye are three sisters. Praise be to
God, all three are of the Kingdom,
and are godly and luminous. Alma
Knobloch raised the Banner of Guid-
ance in Germany and Was unusually
confirmed. Pauline Hannen is, day and
night, busy with self-sacrifice, and thou
also hast no ease, but with heart and
soul art striving to render some service
to the Kingdom of God.
These three sisters are really brilliant
and spiritual, godly and divine. I am
pleased with all three and supplicate to
the Threshold of the Lord of Hosts to
bestow assistance and favor upon ye.
I replied by telegraphic message. It
has of course reached thee.
Convey utmost love and heavenly re-
lationship on my behalf to thy sister
and to Mr. Hannen.
Upon thee be Baha-El-Abha!
