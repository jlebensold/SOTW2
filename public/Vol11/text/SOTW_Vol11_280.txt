to the divine Kingdom and strive that
thou mayest acquire merciful character-
istics, mayest become illumined, of the
Kingdom and lordly. Endeavor to be-
come indifferent to the pleasures of this
World and to its comfort, to remain firm
and steadfast in the Covenant and to
promulgate the Cause of God.
This is the cause of the exaltation of
man, the cause of his glory and of his
salvation.
Upon thee be Baha-el-Aloha!
