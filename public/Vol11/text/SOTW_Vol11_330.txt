hundred tomans had been collected and
a piece of land bought.
"Then later Mirza Mohammed Labib
made the Pilgrimage to Acca, he laid
the project before the Beloved, begging
his blessing and approval, so that this
sherkat (company of shareholders)
might never fail. In reply the M-aster
laid his hands upon his breast, empha-
sizing each word and smiling radiantly
the while saying, "This is my sherkat!
This is my sherkat! Rest assured, this
sherkat is mine!" Then drawing two
gold pieces out of his pocket and hand-
ing them to Mirza Labib: "Let this be
my share of the principal and let all my
dividends be applied on public benefits,
such as schools for the children."
Thereupon Mirza Labib produced a
large record book and Abdul-Baha wrote
the following on the fly-leaf:
Prayer revealed and written in the
house of Abdul-Baha at Haifa, Pales-
tine.-
Is God!
God! Make this company of Bahai
children eternal and everlasting; bestow
blessing and profit and make the mem-
bers successful in excellent administra-
tion, in capacity, faithfulness and integ-
rity; in order to preserve the right of
the children and to act according to
Thy instructions and to form an Assem-
bly of the blessed people so that affairs
be conducted by consultation and not
like other companies to be short lived.
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
Prayer revealed for the Societe
Nonahalan and all combined groups of
children studying Dars Akhlagh 
lessons taken from all Holy Books] 
Through his honor Mirza Mohammed
Labib, the pilgrim.--Upon him be
El-Abha!
Ho Is God!
pure -God! Refresh and vivify
these young shoots of the great river of
guidance, and by the breeze from the
Garden of Oneness grant them joy, and
by the heat of the Sun of Reality be-
stow upon them new life, so that they
may sprout and grow up, progressing
day by day; bud and bring forth leaves
and fruit.
Educator! Give to all intelligence,
grant strength and power and make
them manifestations of helpfulness and
favor, so that they may live among the
people in the utmost degree of dignity.
Thou art the Powerful! the Mighty!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
Upon his return, Mirza Labib urged
the establishment of another Nonahalan
(young plants) center in Teheran, to
which he presented one of these gold
pieces. As an opportunity for the par-
ents to participate, a similar record book
was arranged. In this, then, are duly
numbered and recorded these contribu-
tions to Abdul-Baha's share in the sher-
kat. Naturally such contributions are
open to all the Bahai brotherhood. In-
deed, it is hoped that this work may be
established in every community through-
out the world.
The following are the basic principles
laid down by Abdul-Baha:
1. An executive committee must be
established to draw up and carry out a
set of rules and regulations.
2. Tickets or checks to be of the low-
est denominations.
8. No shareholders to be allowed to
withdraw any of the principal and can
take up interest only at the expiration
of ten years, and then to be allowed to
draw three-fourths of the accumulated
interest, the remaining fourth to be ap-
plied on the public fund.
Respectfully submitted to the STAR or
THE for publication (sealed by
the committee),
Mirza Mohammad Labib,
Miss Lillian F. Kappes,
uredin,
Doctor Susom I. Moody,
