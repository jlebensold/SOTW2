flower of the rose-garden. Upon them

faction in thy trip and has ability and
capacity and Will show thee full consid-
eration, thou mayst select and choose to
be thy fellow-traveler.
Upon the be El-Abha!

MR. AND MRS. KILLIUS
To Mr. and Mrs. A. C. Killius, Montana
them be the Glory of God, the
Most Glorious!
He Is God!
ye two who are firm in the Covenant!
Your letter dated January 28, 1920,
has been received. Its contents were
indicative of heart-felt realities, which
were conducive to firmness and stead-
fastness in the Covenant of God.
Although in the body of the universe
there are innumerable nerves, yet the
main artery, which pulsates, energizes,
and invigorates all beings, is the power
of the Covenant. All else is secondary
to this. Nobody is assisted and con-
firmed save that soul who is firm. Con-
sider it Well that every soul who is firm
in the Covenant is luminous, like unto
a candle which emanates its light on
those around it. While every wavering
soul is an utter failure, frozen, lifeless,
dead yet moving. This one proof is suffi-
cient.
Ye should render thanksgiving unto
God, that ye are able to travel
throughout the states and regio-ns, and
like unto the breeze of spring, transmit
new spirit to every city through which
ye pass.
Praise be unto God, that thy departed
father turned his face to the Supreme
Aspect. He drank from the Chalice of
Guidance, and soared witho-ut feather or
wing to the Infinite Paradise. I am
supplicating unto God that thy hon-
ored mother may also attain to guidance.
The date* 1835 is not lunar, it is solar,
therefore it has not yet arrived.
Praise be unto God, that in Spring-
field, Illinois, the fragrances of the love
of God have been diffused and the call of
the Kingdom hath been raised. The
photograph of dear son Russell was ob-
served. Verily, the expression of his
face indicates great skill. I am beseech-
ing unto God that the friends of that
city may day by day attain unto heav-
enly progress.
Upon ye both be Baha-el-Abha!

urgens, Springfield, 
him be the Glory of God, the Most
Glorious!
He Is God!
dear child 
Thanks be unto God, that in thine
infancy thou hast entered the divine
Kingdom and hast obtained a portion
of the graces of the Lord of Hosts. My
supplication to God is this, that thou
mayest be reared in the bosom of
the love of God, and in the utmost at-
traction attain to thy maturity.
Upon thee be Baha-el-Abha!
