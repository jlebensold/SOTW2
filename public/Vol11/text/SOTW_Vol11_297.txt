"Great importance must be given to the development of the STAR or THE Wzsr. The
circle of its discussion must be widened; in its columns must be published the essential prob-
lems pertaining to the Bahai life in all its phases. Its contents must be so universal that
even the strangers may subscribe to it. Articles must be published, dealing with the uni-
versal principles of the Cause, the writers proving that this Cause takes a vital interest in
afl the social and religious movements of the age and is conducive to the progress of the
world and its inhabitants. In short. the Sun or THE must promote the aspirations and
the ideals that will gather little by little around these general Tablets, bringing into the light
of day all the historical, religious and racial knowledge which will be of the utmost value to
the Bahai teachers all over the world." From Unwiging of the Divine Plan. i

"The kings--may God assist them--
or the counsellors of the 
consult together, and appoint one of the
existing languages, or a new language,
and instruct the children therein in all
the schools of the World, and the same

Glad Tid-in-gs.
"Vie have formerly decreed that
speech was to be in two languages, and
that there should be an effort made to
reduce it into one. So likewise should it be
with the writings of the world, in order
that people may not waste and lavish
their lives in the study of various lan-
guages, and that the Whole earth may be
considered as one city and one land."
