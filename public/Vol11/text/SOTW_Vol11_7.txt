STAR OF THE WEST
nu 

ligions shall be one religion. The day
has dawned in which no racial condi-
tions shall remain. The day has come
when religious bias shall pass away. It
is a day when the oneness of human>>
kind shall uplift its standard. lt is the
day when international peace, like the
true morning, is to Hood the world wvith
its light.
Therefore, We offer the utmost sup~
plication to God, asking Him to dispel
these gloomy clouds and to uproot these
imitations in order that the East and
West may become radiant, that all the
nations of the world shall embrace one
another, and the real spiritual brother--
hood, like the sun of the heavens, may
shine upon all the nations.

(From address delivered by Abdul-Baha before the
International Peace Forum, May 28th, 1912, at Metro-
politan Temple, New York City.)
