STAR OF THE WEST 167
I pray on your behalf that the light
of guidance may shine in the hearts,
divine bestowals may be extended and
heavenly bounty may shine in full radi-
ance.
In this world whatever thou doest is
ultimately fruitless save service to the
Kingdom of God and to all mankind.
Upon thee be greeting and praise!

To Mr. him be 
LLAHI
thou who art firm in the Covenant!
Thy letter was received! It became
the cause of the utmost happiness and
rejoicing; for it contained the news that
the white and the colored are gathered
in one meeting in America and are as-
sociating with each other with infinite
love and kindness. Consider thou the
power of the Wo1*d of God which has
brought together those who were against
each other. To bring the white and the
colored together is considered impossible
and improbable, but the breaths of the
Holy Spirit Will accomplish this fact.
The world of America must be very
thankful for this realization; for this
enmity and hatred which exist between
the white and the colored races is very
dangerous and there is no doubt that it
will end in bloodshed unless the pene-

of the Holy Spirit and the teachings of
are difiused amongst them
and love instead of hatred is established
between the two races.
They must destroy the foundation of
enmity and rancour and lay the basis

Teachings of will cause
the disappearance of this danger from
Americawas completely
attracted to the Kingdom of Abha these
difficulties would not have appeared.
Now he must become a real Bahai so
that the heavenly army may assist and
these troubles may be entirely wiped
away. Write to him to read the suppli-
cations and implore toward the King-
dom of Abha! He must rest assured
that these difficulties will be cleared.
Convey to all the friends of God the
wonderful Abha greeting.
Upon thee be Baha-El~Abha!

thou blossom of the Tree of Life!
Happy art thou to have girded thy
loins in service; to have risen with all
thy power in the promulgation of the
divine teachings, to have convened gath-
erings and to have striven for the exal-
tation of the WVord of God.
In this mortal world every important
matter has an end; and every remark-
able achievement a termination; none
having permanent existence. For in-
stance, consider how the important
achievements of the ancient world have
been at present totally exterminated and
not a trace remains therefrom save the
great Cause of the Kingdom of God,
which has no beginning and will have
no end.
At best, it is only renewed and at the
beginning of each renewal it commands
no attention in the sight of the people.
But when once definitely established, it
