WORDS OF ABDUL-BAHA
"Great importance must be given to the development of the Sun or WEST. The
circle of its discussion must be widened; in its columns must be published the essential prob-
lems pertaining to the Bahai life in all its phases. Its contents must be so universal that
even the strangers may subscribe to it. Articles must be published, dealing with the uni-
versal principles of the Cause, the writers proving that this Cause takes a vital interest in
all the social and religious movements of the age and is conducive to the progress of the
world and its inhabitants. In short, the STAR OF THE must promote the aspirations and
the ideals that will gather little by little around these general Tablets, bringing into the light
of day all the historical, religious and racial knowledge which will be of the utmost value to
the Bahai teachers all over the world." From Unveiling of the Dim." Plan.

Know this for a certainty that today
the penetrative power in the arteries and
the nerves of the world of humanity is
the power of the Covenant. The body
of the world will not be moved through
any power except through the power of
the Covenant. There is no other power
like unto this. Consider what a trans-
formation has been effected since my
first visit. This has been made possible
through the power of the Covenant.

a talk given at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Kinney, New York, December 1,
