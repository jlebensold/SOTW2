 
STAR OF THE WEST Z29
as the globe of the fire of the love of God,
Taereh, Mrs. Consul Schwarz, and the
dear Consul himself; Mr.'Herrigel and
his unique sincerity; Miss Knobloch and
her devotion and productive services;
Miss Kostlin and her purity of faith and
efficiency in service and how she has kept
the Esslingen community in harmony,
love and ardor. He said, 'The Sohwarz
family have become the embodiment of
confirmation!' He then told a Wonder-
ful incident about this family and 
'From this ye can imagine What type of
people they are. Verily, verily, I say
unto ye that a single step that some soul
takes with sincerity in the path of the
Blessed Beauty will never pass unno-
ticed or unrevvarded. It is like unto a
seed which is sown by the farmer. The
rain of Mercy and the heat of the Sun
of Truth help it grow and develop into
a stately tree Whose verdure and shade
will be enjoyed for millenniums.' 
\Ve enjoyed the privilege of associa~
tion with these heavenly souls, andtmany
new souls Who are radiant With the flame
of love. On trains and in various cit-
ies We found souls who Were ready for
the divine Glad Tidings, and the meet-
ings were full of spirituality, the hearts
being melted with love.
The friends in Germany Were very
happy because of the letters they had
received from the friends in England
and America and are very anxious to
increase the correspondence. They re-
quested us to convey to all the friends
the most glorious Abha greetings of love
and unity.
