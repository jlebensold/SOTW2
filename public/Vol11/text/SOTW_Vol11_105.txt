"Great importance must he given to the development of the STAR or run Wssr. The
circle of its discussion must be widened; in its columns must be published the essential prob-
lems pertaining to the Bahai life in all its phases. Its contents must be so universal that
even the strangers may subscribe to it. Articles must be published, dealing with the uni-
versal principles of the Cause, the writers proving that this Cause takes a vital interest in
all the social and religious movements of the age and is conducive to the progress of the
world and its inhabitants. In short, the or rm: WEST must promote the aspirations and
the ideals that_will gather little by little around these general Tablets, bringing into the light
of day all the historical, religious and "racial knowledge which will be of the utmost value to
the Bahan teachers all over the world. From Unveiling of the Did" Plan.

PERSIAN SECTION--(Continued from page 135).
ye who are firm in the Covenant of
the Self-Subsistent, Eternal God! Praise
God with glad faces, for the favors ye
have received and for the gifts which
have come successively to ye; for the
mercy which has preceded ye, for the
blessings which have been fulfilled, and
for the gifts which have been assigned
unto ye. Verily, ye have attained unto
that for which holy men and spiritual
women have earnestly longed. Seize the
opportunity and use your utmost energy
to kindle the fire of the love of God, to
publish the knowledge of God, to diffuse
the Spirit of God, and the fragrances of
the breaths of God, to cause the penetra-
tion of the Word of God.
(Words of Abdul-Baha: Extract from
Tablet revealed for Hoboken Assembly
