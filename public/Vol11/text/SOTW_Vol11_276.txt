Tablets to Bahais in America received in 1919 and 1920
AUGUST RUDD
To his honor, Mr. August Rudd--Upon
him be the Glory of God, the Mo-st
Glorious!
He Is God!
thou son of the Kingdom!
Thy letter was received. Thy desire
is to return to Sweden, thy home. In
the country of Sweden the call of God
is not yet raised. God willing, thou
mayst be confirmed to raise the divine
call in that country and be the cause of
guidance unto a large multitude. Let
not this statement look strange to thee,
because the confirmations of the King-
dom of Abha are powerful. They make
the feeble strong, and give feathers and
wings to the featherless bird.
The maid-servant of God, Miss Knob-
loch, went from America to Germany.
Of course thou hast heard how she
stirred Germany and consequently how
many souls were guided! Now I sup-
plicate to God that thou mayst be more
(than she) confirmed, so that that dark
country of the world of nature may be
illumined with the heavenly luminos-
ity. Feel assured that confirmation Will
reach thee.
Upon thee be Baha-el-Abha!
(Signed) ABBAS.

FERDINAND PETERSON
To his honor Mr. Ferdinand Peterson,
Racine, Wisconsin--Upon him be
El-Abha!
He Is God!
tho-u servant of the Divine Threshold!
Thy letter was received. Thou hadst
written that this year thou hast attended
the Convention, hast been present at
that illumined assemblage, hast heard
those merciful addresses, hast secured a
fresh spirit and hast increased in faith,
assurance and firmness in the Covenant.
Appreciate the value of this lordly
bounty and thank God that thou art
living in the dispensation of the
Covenant, and art attracted to the Sun
of the Reality of the Abha 
May my life be a sacrifice to His friends!
Thou hadst written concerning the
piece of land which thou desirest to sell
and consecrate its price to the Cause of
God. At present'do not hurry, and let
it remain in your hands.
On behalf of the friends in Racine I
supplicate and entreat at the Divine
Threshold, and beg for them a new out-
pouring of the Spirit, so that they may
be stirred and quickened, may be ani-
mated and enlivened, may promulgate
the Divine teachings, strive for the one-
ness of the World of humanity, and serve
the principle of universal peace.

MRS. WAITE
To the attracted maid-servant of God,
Mrs. Shahnaz Waite--Upon her be
the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!
He Is God!
thou sweet singing bird!
The new song* has been received.
Verily, verily art thou raising sweet
melodies in the Rose-garden of the love
of God. The vibration of this melody
Will, forever, give pleasure to the ears
of the children of the Kingdom.
Upon thee be the Glory of God!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
