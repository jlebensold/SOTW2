In looking over the dootor's papers
many letters testifying of his own per-
sonal merit and esteem in the eyes of
the world are found. One of these is of
special interest as it came from Cape
Town at a time when he was quite sick
and showed how his spirit was still liv-
ing in far-away Africa. It reads as
follows:
Cape '1'own, Feb. 28, 1918.
Dear Doctor Buchanan:
It is now some months ago since I sent you
a. duplicate copy of the letter of which I am
now sending you the original, although the
other copy was a. duplicate it contained most
of the signatures which appear on the original
GOPY.
I have not received any reply from you up
to the present and must regretfully conclude
that the last letter miscarried; anyway .the
enclosed letter carried with it not only hearty
good wishes of all the signatories thereto, but
also the very affectionate greetings of all your
many friends, of which I have the honor to be
one. Again with kindest and most hearty greet-
ings to you,
Yours very sincerely.
JOHN S. INCE.

Wnsr, Vol. 10, page 42.
Life t-his side of the veil is brief, and prob-
ably none of us will see you in the flesh again,
but there is the great Beyond.
May God be with you, old friend, until we
meet again.
Yours very sincerely,
(Signed by tWenty--seven names.)
However, there was but little of the
doctor's life and worthy deeds recorded
by himself. He had attained the sta-
tion of selflessness. The loftiness of his
thoughts and aspirations as found in his
sermons and lectures are theymost fitting
record of his daily life. His manuscripts
are rich in spiritual thought. His last
effort was an outline for a book on the
"Bahai Cause but his ill-health prevented
his completion of the work. He had nine
chapters outlined with three headings
as follows:
Bahctt Principles
1. Justice.
2. Unity.
3. Peace.
Bahai Untversals
4. Education.
5. Language.
6. Franchise.
Bahai Economics
7. Co-operation.
8. Equal Opportunity.
9. Spiritual Development.
One of his greatest joys was to have
the friends come to him and read from
the Hidden Words. The last time a
group of the friends Were with him,
after the reading he remarked: "Never
in all literature have I read such match-
less beauty of wording and imagery of
thought." His passing has grieved the
heart because of separation, yet he has
now undertaken that journey on the
Pathway of Knowledge of the Infinite
God, with greater freedom and under-
standing, and with the aid and prayer
of the Center of the Covenant may he
ever ascend in glorious works, in the
Name of the Lord, to the full realization
of these thoughts from one of his
sermons:
"Material death but ushers in the higher state
To the spirit it butigives divinity;
Dissolution is but the second birth of the soul,
"I'is but the new nativity.
Resurrection of the life Ymaterial existeth not.
