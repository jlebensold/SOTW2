the maid-servant of God, Mrs. Jennie

He Is God!
thou leaf of the Tree of L-ife!
Your letter has been received. Be-
cause you are exceedingly worthy of an
answer, therefore this epistle has been
written.
Happy is thy condition for the thickly
condensed clouds did not prevent thee
from seeing the Sun o-f Reality. With
thine own ear thou hast heard the call of
the Kingdom of God and with thine 
thou hast witnessed the lights of guid-
ance. Rest thou assured that thou art
under the protection of the Lord of
Hosts and art considered one of the
daughters of the Kingdom. Appreciate
thou this station because this is a great
station.
Convey thou, on my behalf, to thy re-
vered husband the utmost kindness.
Likewise, to the children.
Upon thee be El-Baha-el-Abha!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.

THE WEST
For a long time I have desired to
correspond with thee, but I had no time
whatever. At present as the respected
maid-servant of God, Mrs. True, is re-
turning to those regions, I am writing
thee in brief that thou mayest know
that thou art ever within sight and pres-
ent before me.
I beg for thee from the bounties of
God advancement in the Kingdom and
nearness to His Highness the Merciful
One. Thy services in the Spiritual As-
sembly are accepted in the sight of the
Almighty and are well known to the
friends. I supplicate thy reward from
His Holiness 
Upon thee be Baha-El-Abha!

JAMES SIMPSON
To his honor, Mr. James Simpson, Wash-
ington, D. C.--Upon him be 
LLAH El-Abha!
Is God!
thou servant of God!
Thy letter and thy poems arrived.
lilrom their contents it became known
that, praise be to God, thou art ablaze
with the burning fire of the love of God,
hast secured a share and portion from
the bounty of the Spirit and hast pur-
posed to render a distinguished service
to the divine Kingdom and to be the
cause of the promulgation of the one-
ness of mankind.
If it is possible and easy, undertake
a journey to North Africa and .enkindle
there the fire of the love of God and
summon the souls to the Revelation of
and to the unity of man-
kind, so that religous, racial, sectarian
and prejudice may not remain
and all may be brought to a full realiza-
tion of the Truth. If thou goest, as-
suredly the confirmations of God shall
assist thee.
