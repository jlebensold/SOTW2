the leadership of the movement in the
hands of his son, Abbas, also a prisoner,
saying, have established a new coven-
ant between God and Man, and my son
is the centre of that covenant."
His son took the title of Abdul Baha,
or The Servant of God, literally, the
Slave of the Glory, and the name.of
Abdul=Baha has already become known
everywhere, the synonym for service, lo've
and wisdom. He was freed from im-
prisonment in 1908, through the action
of the constitutional revolution in Turkey,
and since then has travelled in western
countries, visiting America in 1912.
The Bahai Revelation, as it is some-
times called, inspires a movement, not a
sect. It hasa very slight organization
embodied in a Unity Board, which man-
ages the Temple fund. The temple will
be a great place of worship for all man-
kind. Its doors will never be closed;
no priesthood will ever offilciate within
its walls; about it will be gardens and
fountains; and beyond these, a series
of buildings devoted to the application of
true religion to life, a hospital, an orphan
asylum, a hospice or house of hospitality,
a guild house, a university, etc. Only
worship can be voiced in the temple itself;
but the results of such worship are to be
evidenced in these surrounding buildings,
where all activities of the community will
meet in the comradeship inspired by
mutual counsel from which criticism and
politics shall have been banished.
