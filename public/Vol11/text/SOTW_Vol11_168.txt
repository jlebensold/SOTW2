168 STAR OF THE WEST
will daily advance and in its daily exal-
tation will reach the supreme heavens.
For instance, consider the day of
Christ, which was the day of the renewal
of the Kingdom of God. The people
of the world attached no importance to
it and did not realize its significance to
such an extent that the Tomb of His
Holiness the Christ remained for three
hundred years lost and unknown, until
the maid-servant of God, Helene, the
mother of Constantine arrived and dis-
covered the sacred spot.
My purpose in all this is to show how
unobservant are the people of the world
and how ignorant, and on the day of the
establishment of the Kingdom, they will
remain heedless and negligent.
Ere long the power of the Kingdom
will encompass all the world and then
they will be awakened and will cry and
lament over those who were oppressed
and martyred, and will raise their sighs
and moanings. Such is the nature of
people.
Praise thou God, therefore, that thou
hast offered thyself in the early days of
the renewal, has known the Lord of the
Kingdom, and hast become one of the
hosts of the Kingdom. The results of
this guidance and this bounty will, like
unto a star, shine from the horizon of
the Kingdom, and will illumine the
world.
Upon thee be El-Abha!

Abha!--to his honor Dr. Hills Cole--
Upon him be El-Abha!
He Is Gaol!
thou who art firm in the Covenant!
The friends of God are most pleased
with thee. They have loosened their
tongues in thy praise that thou art firm
in the Covenant and Testament and art
self-sacrificing in the Path of God.
I hope from the bestowals of the True
Dne that thou mayst advance in the
Kingdom of God and become conducive
to the guidance of souls.
Upon thee be El-Abha!

ELIZABETH STEVENS
To the maid-servant of God, Elizabeth
Stevens--Upon her be 
E1-Abha!
Is God!
thou daughter of the Kingdom!
Two letters have been received from
thee, one from New York and another
from Bermuda. Verily, thy letter was
eloquent and from it the purpose was
quite manifest. Thou didst well to un-
dertake such a good voyage to Bermuda.
I entreat and supplicate to the divine
Kingdom and beg for thee the confirma-
tions of the Kingdom. Rest thou as-
sured, thou shalt be confirmed. Engage
with all the power of thy heart in the
promulgation of divine teachings in
those islands, and be certain that the
doors will be Wide opened.
After this war, all men are thirsty for
universal_ peace, and the Divine Teach-
ings lay the foundation of universal
peace and promulgate the oneness of the
world of humanity. Praise thou God,
that He hast made thee of the chosen
and has selected thee for the promul-
gation of heavenly teachings. Be as-
sured that thou shalt be confirmed.
Convey on my behalf the utmost. love
a.nd kindness to the maid-servants of
God, Maud Gaudreaux and Agnes Alex-
ander.
Upon thee be Baha-E1-Abha!
