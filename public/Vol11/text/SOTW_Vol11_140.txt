77ze MODEL FOR 
BAI-IAI TEMPLE. CHICAGO
LOUIS 1. BOURGEOIS, AIICI-IITECT

HE model designed by Louis J.
I Bourgeois for the great Bahai
Temple to be built in Chicago is
attracting much attention from archi-
tects. It is of unusual interest from
several points of view. The Temple is a
new and original
form in architec-
ture--"the first new
idea in architecture
since the thirteenth
century," according
to Mr. H. Va 
Buren Magonigle.
Beautiful in the
harmony of its pro-
portions, it has in
addition a singular
charm in its sym-
bolism; and to the
it is
noteworthy,because
th creator de-
clares: "It is Baha
O1lah's temple. I
am only the channel
through i it
came."
In form the tem-
ple is a nonagon, or
nine-sided struc-
ture, and its lower
story offers a complete innovation in
architecture in the use of nine inverted
half circles, with a great doorway in the
centre of each, so that from whatsoever
side one approaches the edifice it' seems to
extend its arms in welcome. From dome
to foundation it is a unique creation and
unlike any building in existence, yet one
reads in its curving beauty the story of
the architecture of the world. The first
floor in its simplicity of line suggests the

Greek and Egyptian' temples; while the
treatment of the doors and windows is
Romanesque in form, and both Gothic
and Arabic in the intricacy and beauty of
ornamentation. The second story is
Renaissance in line and Gothic in the in-
terlaced arches of
its openings. The
ithird is restful,
quiet and Renais-
sance in treatment.
Above it rises a
lovely dome, sug-
gestive of Byzan-
tine forms; but
above the closed
top rise other beams
of the dome itself
like hands clasped
in prayer, so that
the dome gives the
feeling of ascen-
sion and aspiration
found previously in
the Gothic towers
alone.
In the geometric
forms of the orna-
mentation covering
the columns and
surrounding win-
dows and doors of
the temple, one deciphers all the re-
ligious symbols of the world. Here are
the swastika cross, the circle, the triangle,
the double triangle or six pointed star
(or S0l0m0n's seal, the magic symbol of
-necromancers of old); but more than
this, the noble symbol of the spiritual
Orb, or Sun behind the Saviour of man-
kind; the five pointed star, representing
the man or Buddha or
Mohammed; the Greek Cross, the Roman
