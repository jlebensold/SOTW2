the Unity or Executive Board and the
assembled delegates in the annual Con-
vention, quotling as follows from the
blessed instructions:
"The nat.ion choo-ses representatives.

all affairs are in the hands of the as-
sembly of the nation, not in the hands
of everybody. This assembly of the na-
tion, or parliament, those members are
elected by the nation; all affairs are re-
ferred to parliament, not to the people.
Parliament discusses affairs and reaches
a decision. The Convention is like that
and this meeting sees to the afiairs and
Whatever the meeting decides, the Ex-
ecutive Board must carry out."
