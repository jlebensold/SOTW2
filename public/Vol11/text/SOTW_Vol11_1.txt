"We desire but the good of the world and the
happiness of the nations; that all nations shall
become one in faith and all men as brothers;
that the bonds of and unity between
the sons of men shall be strengthened, that
diversity of religion shall cease and difierences
of race be annulled. S0 it shall be; these fruit-
less strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away,
and the 'Most Great Peace' shall come."
