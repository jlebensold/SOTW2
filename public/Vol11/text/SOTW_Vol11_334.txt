334 STAR OF THE WEST
From death and Sheol the body corporate n'ere
again doth rise.
But as of yore, so now the spirit, the soul in-
carnate
Doth infrequently materialize.
Yea, as Jesus died before, apostles and unbe-
lievers to illume.
So now the spirit transfigurate doth its 
form transciently assume.
Ascension is the life ethereal from earth to
heaven ascending,
'Tis but the ceaseless spirit's flight.
'Tis the dawn of angelhood.
'Tis but the shedding of garb,
"Dis the soul's investiture with Heaven's Light."
George Latimer.
MRS. M. D. THUMEL AND
KARL HANSON
On the 2nd of March the Portland,
Oregon, Bahai Assembly and other
friends gathered at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. VV. J. Haldeman to pay the last
tribute of love and esteem to our dear
sister Mrs. M. D. Thumel, who departed
from this plane of life Feb. 28th, to
ascend to her station in the eternal King-
dom of El-Abha. We feel assured she
has come i11to"'her own" through the
blessed grace of the Father, assisted and
strengthened through her Wonderful
firmness and faith in The Center of The
Covenant.
Mrs. Thumel Was born in Brooklyn,
N. Y., Jan. 24th, 1862, and When only
a young child became an ardent Spirit-
ualist, but when she heard of the Bahai
Revelation, it took such an immediate
and firm hold on her that she not only
accepted the teachings of 
absolutely, but her faith in the Center
of the Covenant became a part of her
consciousness, and _no greater triibute
can be paid our departed sister than to
reiterate her firmness and love for Abdul-
Baha under all conditions and cir-
cumstances.
The Bahai service was most ably a11d
beautifully conducted by our beloved
brother George O. Latimer and the
power and love of the Master was mani-
fested through him in a Wonderful
manner.
Bahai were rendered in sweet-
ness and pathos by a quartette of maid-
servants which added that touch of
spirituality possible only through the
melody of the human voice.
Mrs. Thumel leaves two daughters,
Mrs. Drucilla Haldeman of this city and
Mrs. Mae Bell Hanson Schroeder of
Chicago.
Just five months a11d a day Mrs.
Thumel assisted at the services of her
eldest grandson, who passed at that time
Hanson, a very lovable boy and
a firm Bahai," strong, very strong for a
child, in faith to the Center of the
Covenant.
'The Bahai service for Karl was also
conducted by brother George Latimer,
beautiful in its simplicity and full of
love and aifection.
B. N. Bowman.
