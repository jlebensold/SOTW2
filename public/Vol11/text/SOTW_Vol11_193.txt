STAR OF THE WEST 193
The chair called upon the treasurer
of the Unity, Mr. Randall, to give his
report at this time, which was done.
The report shown in brief was as fol-
lows:
"That up to April 1st, 1920, which
does not include anything which came
in since the month of April, 1920, we
have--
United States treasury cer-
tificates of indebtedness,
which are short-time ma-
turities maturing in a few
years and paying Another issue of United
States certificates of in-
debtedness . . . . . . . . . . .
..
Cash balance in the North-
ern Trust Company April
1st, 1920 . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. .
Liberty bonds received to
date . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
..
Liberty bonds received since
April 1st, 1919, with last
year's accumulated inter10,000.00
20,173.72
28,050.00
5,600.00
Making a total now of
practically (counting
Liberty bonds as cash). 
So that with the $12,000 or $15,000
raised here, we are very near to the
$200,000. We hope there will be some
more contributions to raise that to
$200,000. These books are turned over
to the auditing committee."
The treasurer brought to the atten-
tion of the Convention in connection
with his report, a pending question as
to what should be done with reference
to the refunding of a certain contribu-
tion previously made and now desired
or needed by the contributor. It hav-
ing been brought out that in a Tablet
from Abdul-Baha dated January 23,
1920, this matter was referred to the
Convention, and certain legal consider-
ations in connection therewith having
been explained, it was moved, seconded
and carried that the amount so contrib-
uted, plus the interest, received by the
Unity, be returned to the contributor;
provided he is now ready to receive it,
and the treasury is authorized to make
this payment; provided, however, that
it suificiently appears that the legal
questions involved are such as to give
authority to the Convention to take
this action.
The chair announced the appointment
of an auditing committee to go over
the books of the treasurer, as follows:
Edward D. Struven of Beverly, Mass,
and Mrs. Mabel S. Rice-Wray of De-
troit, Mich.
The status of the present Bahai Pub-
lishing Society and the best means of
expanding this work was now discussed
by several of the delegates. It was
moved, seconded and unanimously car-
ried that the matter of publication of
the American addresses of Abdul-Baha
and the Work of the Publishing Society
to the end that the necessary financing
may be done and the addresses pub-
lished, be referred to the Executive
Board.
The committee on the nomination of
the teaching committee reporting
through Mrs. Hoagg announced the fol-
lowing nominations:

Mills, Mrs. Deuth. From the South:
