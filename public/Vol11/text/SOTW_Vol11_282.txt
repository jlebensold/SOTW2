He Is Goal!
Thou shouldst say:*
am a Bahai and am a friend to all religions
and nations. I consider all to be of one race
and count them as my relatives. I have divine
love and not racial and sectarian love. Accord-
ing to the explicit written Command of BAHA-
I do not pronounce a word pertaining
to politics, because we are forbidden to interfere
in political affairs. We are concerned with af-
fairs Which are heavenly. We are servants unto
the World of morality. We consider that re-
ligious, racial, political and national prejudices
are destructive to the world of humanity. We
believe that the whole of the surface of the earth
constitutes one home and all mankind form one
family. With all we associate in the utmost sin-
cerity and kindness."
ABBAS

He Is God!
thou dear rnaid~servant of God!
Thy letter has been received. Veriiy, thy sister has lighted a lamp in Germany. God
willing, thou wilt be to a larger extent confirmed. Thou wilt kindle a luminous lamp. It may
be the Government of those regions will check thee. Thou shouldst say: . . [see above].
Upon thee be the Glory of Abha!
