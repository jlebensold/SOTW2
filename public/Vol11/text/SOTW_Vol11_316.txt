cognizant of the Divine World and those of the spirits. Reality is pure spirit,
it is not physical: that is, it does not occupy space.
Ye should esteem Mirza Ahmed Khan (Yazdani) highly, because it was
he who gave ye this great glad tiding. Through the graces of God do I hope
that that country will be enkindled With heavenly Light: that the Divine
verses will be chanted, and that such souls may be confirmed as to become
like unto Paul and Mary Magdalene.
Unto thee be greeting and praise!
