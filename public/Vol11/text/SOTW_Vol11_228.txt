228 STAR OF THE WEST
LETTER FROM HARLAN F. OBER
TO THE TEACHING COMMITTEE
. . . Our journey through Germany
Was a heavenly journey, filled with vivid
and happy memories. We stayed three
Weeks in Stuttgart and Esslingen, hold-
ing many public meetings and visiting
in many of the homes. The love, unity
and faithfulness of the German friends
must be seen to be realized. Their as-
semblies are fragrant with the perfume
of spirituality. No Words can describe
them as they are described by Abdul-
mans are receiving the Americans! This
is because they are the lovers of the Holy
Cause, and its principles, striving for
the fulfillment of its great purpose. Na-
tional prejudices cannot interfere in
their religion. God and Religion is to
them superior to every other phase of
life. Therefore it is no Wonder that you
see they are blessed and confirmed in
their religious life. The Blessed Beauty
