MR. AND MRS. DEUTI-I
To their honors, Mr. and Mrs. 
Upon them be El-Abha!
of his honor, Mr. Albert Vail-
Upon him be El-Abha!
He Is God!
ye two servants of the Kingdom of
God!
His honor, Mr. Vail, has arrived and
With an eloquent tongue and a brilliant
language has been praising you very
highly; that these two respected souls
are indeed two truthful servants of the
Word of God and are day and night
roaring and surging like unto the sea.
They have no purpose save the promul-
gation of the teachings of 
and seek nothing save the guidance of
souls. They have established a maga-
zinei' which promotes the Bahai ideals,
Which declares the oneness of mankind,
which sets forth the inner meanings and
the realities of things, which expounds
the mysteries of God and the Words of
Which glitter like unto pearls. This fig-
ure is an oriental figure by which elo-
quent and significant Words are com-
pared to pearls. But these pearls are
of two kinds, one is the versified lan-
guage and that is called poetry and the
other is the o-rdinary language called
prose. Now I pray to God that ye may
both in prose as well as poetry set forth
glittering gems and may be so confirmed
that all your publications may be favor-
able to every sound intellect and suit-
able to all praiseworthy characters, and
that no one will be able to criticize them
or make the slightest objections.
In the utmost supplication, I beseech
divine providence that He may bestow
His favors upon you in this World and
in the next.
Upon ye be Baha-el-Abha!

God! Make this magazine a mir-
ror of Truth that therein the divine
significances may be reflected, the mys-
teries of the Kingdom may be revealed,
and that it may appear effulgent and re-
splendent to the eyes of men. Thou art
the promulgator of publications that
serve the world of humanity!
