CHARLES H. GREENLEAF
A great pioneer of the Bahai Cause
in America, his honor Charles H. Green-
leaf, came to the end of the trail of this
life, May 24th, 1920. He Was
a giant in mind and body, and a guide
to great numbers of souls in their search
for Truth. He was one of the three
recognized pillars of strength of the
Cause in the early days--being closely
associated with Thornton Chase and
Arthur S. Agnew. Those Who received.
the M.essage of the Kingdom from him
remember his logical presentations and
powerful arguments--qualities that were
needed to convince the Western mind,
especially When, at that time, there were
very few of the words of 
and Abdul-Baha translated into Eng-
lish.
V\7e ever think of him as the associate
of Thornton Chase, whom Abdul-Baha
termed "a twinkling star on the hori-
zon of Truth, at present hid behind the
clouds, but which shall soon radiantly
shine forth."
A noble soul has passed. "Ya-Bahae
el-Abhal"
Tablet from Abdul-Baha.
Through his honor Mr. Chase to Mr.
Charles H. Creen1eaf--Upon him be
BAHA I
Is God!
thou member of the Merciful Meet-
ing!
Mr. Chase ofiered the highest praise
for you, and While in the Blessed Spot
(Acea) he remembered you always.
Know thou his value, for he is a kind
and faithful friend, firm in the Cove-
nant and Testament.
thou who art firm in the Covenant!
Thy services and those of thy revered
wife are acceptable in the Kingdom of
Abha, for ye have made your home a
nest for the birds of God, and have
engaged in teaching the Cause of God.
Ye are truthful gardeners of the
Garden of C-od, and two agreeable serv-
ants of the Holy Threshold.
This confirmation must become the
source of joy to life and repose to the
conscience.
Upon thee be Baha-el-Abhal
(Signed) ABDUL--BAHA ABBAS.

Wisconsin, May 6, 1857. His parents

years old the family moved to Califor-

the mountains, he spent the happiest
days of his childhood, not realizing any
of the hardships which inevitably at-

years of turmoil after his return to the
middle west, the visions of snow capped
