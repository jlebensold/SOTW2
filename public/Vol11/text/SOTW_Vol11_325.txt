in the effort to meet Abdul-Baha at the
R-aces' Congress in London, though We
eventually spent one month there in the
daily hope of his arrival. After writing
and cabling and much uncertainty, word
came to Tammadon-ul-Molk, his inter-
preter, Who was in the same house with
us, and Miss Juliet Thompson, of New
York, who lodged next door, to proceed
selves at Thonon. Though we did not
know it, Abdul-Baha Was at that moment
abroad on the lake with M. and Mme.
Dreyfus-Barney, Juliet Thompson, Mir-
za Raffie and several Orientals, and
when, after resting, six hours later We
were greet-ed and called to meet him,
and I told him of what I called my
dream mountains, those self-same hills

The most difficult task for the
Society of Khademeen Atfal (those
devoting their services to children)
is to announce to the friends of God
the death of our American Bahai
sister, Miss Lillian Frances Kappes.
This revered and blessed soul, who
in the year 1911, came from America
to Persia in the services of the Tar-
biat School, and spent her precious
life in educating her Persian sisters,
passed on to the Threshold of the
Almighty at the age of about thirty,
on Wednesday morning, December
lst, Nineteen hundred and twenty,
and left the traces of her qualities
and virtues in the hearts. The only
consolation that we have is that Miss
Lillian Kappes has not really died,
for though her physical temple has
put on the garment of death her holy
spirit is clothed with the silken robe
of Life and will live forever and
forever.

Miss Stewart and I were telegraphed for

doubly beautiful for his presence there.
Ignorant of the point of our debarka-
tion, I was admiring, from the lake
steamer, an exquisite, ethereal looking
range of mountains, rising as if from
the heavenly deeps, and as our boat drew
nearer, a sweet, peaceful looking village

he sat at the window, he said: "Some-
times the heart sees what the eyes can-
not see." Then, "If it were not for the
Cause of we would never
have have known each other
--you would not be here." We were
there two days, and, with many to see
him, our interviews were perforce short
though both evenings, at dinner, we sat
opposite him at the same table. The
first evening he told several humorous
stories, but the second all his talk was
