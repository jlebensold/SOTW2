STAR OF THE WEST
TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA
thou STAR or THE West'!
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere
long, thou shalt become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime.
Thou art the first paper of the Bahais which is organized in the country of America. Al-
though for the present thy subscribers are limited, thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet
shouldst thou stand unshakable, become the object of the attention of the friends and the
center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the Covenant, in the fu-
ture thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto the waves of the sea; thy volume
will increase, thy arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will be raised
and become won-ld~wide-and at last thou shalt become the first paper of the world of human-
ity. Yet all these depend upon firmness firmness, firmness!

. . . Similarly, the Magazine, the STAR or THE WEST, must be edited in the utmost
regularity, but its contents must be the promulgator of the' Cause of God--so that both in the
East and the West, they may become informed with the most important events.

October 9th, 1920.
Dear Bahai friends:
Dr. Zia M. Bagdadi, accompanied by
his wife, his little child, and his wife's
sister, arrived in this city October 4th,
after nearly a year 's stay in Haifa,
Palestine, bringing with them a letter
of new permission which reads:
To the friends of God, America--Unto
them be the Glory of God, the Most
Glorious!
He Is God!
ye friends of God!
His honor Dr. Zia (M. Bagdadi) and
the maid-servant of God Zeenat, stayed
in the Holy Land for quite a long time.
Now they are returning with the maid-
servant of God, Hobour, to America. As
they have attained to the privilege of
visiting two Holy Thresholds, that is, the
Threshold of His Holiness, 
and Makam Aala (His Holiness, the
Bab), ye should practice the utmost con-
sideration towards them. I feel the ut-
most affection towards them.
Upon ye be the glory of Abha!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
