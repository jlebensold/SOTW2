WORDS OF ABDUL-BAHA
"Great importance must be given to the development of the STAR or THE The
circle of its discussion must be widened; in its columns must be published the essential prob-
lems pertaining to the Bahai life in all its phases. Its contents must be so universal that
even the strangers may subscribe to it. Articles must be published, dealing with the uni-
versal principles of the Cause, the writers proving that this Cause takes a vital interest in
all the social and religious movements of the age and is conducive to the progress of the
world and its inhabitants. In short, the STAR or TI-IE must promote the aspirations and
the ideals that will gather little by little around these general Tablets, bringing into the light
of day all the historical, religious and racial knowledge which will be of the utmost value to
the Bahai teachers all over the Worldl" From of the Divine Plan.

Unveiling of the Divine Plan for the VVorldTablet revealed by ABDUL-BAI-IA.
We do not look at the evil deeds of the
people. We do not consider the race, the
religion, or nationality. We do our ut-
most to help everyone. The inhabitants
of these parts know this and, therefore,
whenever they are in difficulties, or have
had business reverses they come to us
and We Will never send them away u11-
aided or deprived. This is the quality
of the Bahais. This is the conduct of
the believers. This is the path of the
kingdom of God.
