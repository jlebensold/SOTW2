swept away, and that beneath thee we
may dwell when the earth shall be re-
newed, and I beg that I may be accept-
ed in the Glorious Kingdom, and that
my name may be registered in the book
of the favorites. And I also beg the
blessing of the worlds to come and the
present one, for myself and for those who
are near and dear to me, and for the
gifts and powers to enable me to impart
this Great Truth: The Coming of The
Kingdom of the people of my
country, or for the spiritual gifts for
which thou seest me best fitted. And I
ask that in me the work of human hands
may glorify God and that beauty which
is His and which He has given as a
token may be inward in me and in my
work testify of Him.

of Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, May 13, 1914.)
'W!ill is the center or focus of human
understanding. We must will to know
God, just as We must will in order to
possess the 1i-fe He has given us. The
human will must be subdued and trained
into the will of God. It is a great power
to have a strong will, but a greater
power to give that will to God. The
will _is what we do, the understanding
is what we know. Will and understand-
ing must be one in the cause o-f God. In-
tention brings attainment.
