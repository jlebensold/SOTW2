The Cause of the creation of all contingent
beings has been love, as it is mentioned in
the famous tradition: was a hidden
treasure, and I loved to be known. There-
fore I created the creation in order to be
known." Thus all must gather on the
(shores) of theriver of the love of God in
such wise that there should not blow any
Wind of discord among the friends and com-
panions. All should look to love, and con-
duct (the life) in the utmost of unity so
that there should not be seen any difference
among them (the friends), and they should
share With one another loss and gain, hard
time and Welfare, and accidents. Vi/Te hope,
God Willing, that the breeze of unity will
waft from the city of the Lord of the serv-
ants, and all be clothed with the raiment of
unity, love and resignation.
