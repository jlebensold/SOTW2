becoming a verdant garden; the deserts and
mountains are teeming with red flowers; from
the borders of the wilderness the tall grasses

birds? They are from the melodies of peace
and reconciliation, of love and unity, of justice

the Pole-star of the world, under whose shelter
the beloved shall rejoice and the pure hearts
shall repose in peace.
