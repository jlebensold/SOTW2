looked at him, then at others, and
smiled.
"Haji Mullah Abou Taleb is my
friend," he said. "He looked just as
old forty years ago when he came to
this blessed spot for the first time. Now
he has come never to leave. Are you
Well a11d happy? How can you descend
and ascend the mountain every day?" A
Then he came very near to him and
looked at his thin and soiled
overcoat.
"Hast thou not received thy new
overcoat? I have brought one for thee.
I will send it up for thee. Man must
keep his clothes always clean and spot-
less."
He answered: am not particular
about my outward clothes, but the robe
of the virtue of God is necessary for us."
Immediately Abdul-Baha's face lighted
up:
"Thou art right, the believers of God
must ever strive to clot-he their spiritual
bodies with the garment of the virtue
of God, the robe of the fear of God, and
the vesture of the love of God. These
robes will never become threadbare. They
will never be out of fashion. Their mar-
ket values do not fluctuate. They are
always negotiable and ever on demand.
They are the means of the adornment of
the temple of man and woman.
"But the outward raiment must be
also clean and immaculate, so that the
outer may be a. faint expression of the
inner. Cleanliness is one of the funda-
mental laws of this religion."
Mashrak-El-Azkar Contribution from Cairo
Cairo, Egypt, November 30, 1916.
Mr. Alfred E. Lunt.
Dear Bahai Brother:
Sometime ago I received a letter from
you in regard to the Maslira-k-El-Azkar
Work. You were then Secretary of the
Bahai Temple Unity Executive Board,
now I believe you are President.
It gives me great pleasure to enclose
a check for $75.00 for the Mashrek-EL
Azkar in America. This amount is from
the Egyptian Bahais of Cairo and Alex-
andria, in vvhich two cities I do my Bahai
work, as I usually pass the summers in
Alexandria. The majority of the Bahais
are poor and could not give, but those
who have contributed have done so very
joyfully. It is sent with Bahai love and
greetings from all here to all the B-ahai
friends in the 'West. Mr. Mohamed Said
helped me in collecting this money. Sev-
eral years ago a contribution was sent by
the older Bahais here.
