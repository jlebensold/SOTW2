despondent! This is the conduct and
the manner of the people of Baha! You
should conform your" conduct with the
advices of Abdul-Baha!
('Words of Abdul-Baha: From tablet
to New York Assembly of Bahais; trans-
lated by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, May 9,
1909.)
May they attain to such heights of
altruism as to be ready to sacrifice their
lives for each other! This is the life of
the World of humanity! This is in ac-
cord with the good-pleasure of the
Blessed Perfection!
(Words of Ab-dul-Baha, from the Diary
of Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, October 12,
1914.)
A man must ever think of the protec-
tion of others and not of himself.
(Words of Abdul-Baha; from the Diary
of Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, October 12,
1914.)
Man must always associate with those
from whom he can get light or be with
those to Whom he can give light, He
must either receive or give instructions;
otherwise, being with people without
these two intentions, is spending one's
time for nothing and by so doing he
is neither gaining nor causing people to
gain.
(Words of Abdul-Baha: From Kinney-
Beede-Thompson Notes; taken at Acca,
July 5, 1909.)
thou maid-servant! Have great
magnanimity so that thou mayest b-e
favored in the threshold of the Almighty.
Have lofty aspirations so that thou
mayest attain in the kingdom of God
to eternal life.
(Words of Abdul-Baha: From tablet
translated by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, June
17, 1914.)
It is possible to so adjust one 's self to
the practice of nobility that its atmos-
THE 
phere surrounds and colors all our acts.
When these acts are habitually and eon-
scientiously adjusted to noble standards
with no thought of the Words that might
herald them then nobility becomes the
accent of life. At such a degree of evo-
lution one scarcely needs to try to be

distinctive expressioii of nobility.
(Words of Abdul-Baha: From notes of
Mrs. Mary Hanford Ford; taken in
Paris, France, 1911.)
Today the real king is the soul who
serves all, and dear is he who exhibits
humility toward all humanity. The
humbler and lowlier a person shall be
the nearer to and more acceptable at the
threshold of God is he.
The Beauty of Abha, Baha'o'llah, said
that the one nearest the threshold of God
is he who serves all and who considers
himself evanescent and non-existent; who
forgets himself utterly, turns to God
alone and for the sake of God serves all
mankind.
(From Address given by Abdul-Baha,
Washington, D. (1., May 12, 1912.)

people of the world! I command
you to that which is the cause of exalt-
ing your stations. Hold fast to divine
piety and adhere to the hem of that
which is just. Truly I say, the tongue
is for honorable mention; pollute it not
with evil speech. God hath forgiven
that which is past. Henceforth ye must
all speak in that which is proper. Ab-
stain from cursing, reviling and that
which is annoying to man.
(Words of Baha'o '1lah: Kttab-El-Ahd-.)
Work for the sake of God and for the
improvement of humanity, Without any
expectation of praise and reward. The
present (is always) unimportant, but we
must make our present so filled with
mighty and altruistic deeds as to assume
