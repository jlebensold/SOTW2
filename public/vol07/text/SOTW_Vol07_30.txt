Mrs. Fannie Dunn
March 9,1916,Mrs.Fannie Dunn,
0 Wife of Hyde Dunn, passed on.
With the passing of Mrs. Dunn
the San Francisco Assembly registered
its first "In occasion
of quickened human sadness, but a sea-
son of great spiritual illumination.
In B-ahai experience the San Francisco
Assembly has indeed had its days of be-
ginning, days of feebleness, when in very
truth but two or three would gather to-
gether. But, Whether in those days or
these of greater fullness, none has W0-ven
more closely the bonds of love and stead-
fastness than Hyde Dunn. Of him, it
was conceded that he was kind and served
With love.
To his good Wife, the object of his
yearning a.nd' devotion, for a long time
the "tales of the past" Were the Words
of leading; for her, the Hidden Words
were still a sealed book.
The sign of love is patience.
Then came the days of the end: The
pilgrimage in "the valley of the shadow"
Was long, painful, overb-urdened. Bahai
arms upheld the stricken one; Bahai love
whispered 'Be strong 
Praise be to God, as the journey
shortened, the Light became clearer,
brighter, purer, and in the finality the
dominance of the Spirit heralded a tri-
umph Which despoiled death of its prow-
ess and the grave of its victory!
The end was glorious: It was Bahai.
To the Assembly, this consecration of
the first fruits was a Wonderful teaching,
a conviction that "freedom from the
riches of self" is the Wealth that trans-
forms "My Calamity into My Provi-
dence," Whereby the Children of the
Spirit become "the Stars of My Omni-
presence forever."
"Herein there is no death, no trouble,
no burden."
