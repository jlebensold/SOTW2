"T/zis is i/ze Time!"
IT is recorded in the blessed Gospel:
Tm/vel ye throughout the world and call
ye the people to the of God!
Now this is the time that you may arise and
perform this most great service and become
the cause of the guidance of the innumerable
souls. Thus through this superhuman serv-
ice the rays of peace and conciliation may
illumine and enlighten all the regions and
the World of humanity may find peace and
composure.
During my stay in America I cried out in
every meeting and summoned the people to
the propagation of the ideals of universal
peace. I said plainly that the continent of
Europe had become like unto an arsenal and
its conflagration Was dependent upon one
spark, and that in the coming years, or With-
in tvvo years, all that Which is recorded in
the Revelation of John and the Book of
Daniel Would become fulfilled and come to
pass.
