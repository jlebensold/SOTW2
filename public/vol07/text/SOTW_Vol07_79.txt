and Whenever I ask him What the mat-
ter is, he does not answer.'
His Holiness said to her: 'Send him
to me.' 
Her son came in the evening. The
mother said: my son, this is a great
personage, and, if you have any trouble,
tell him about it.' Then the son went
and sat down in the holy presence.
Jesus said: "Tell me What art thou
suffering from."
The son: am not suffering."
Jesus: "Do not speak a lie. Thou
hast an incurable malady. Tell it to
me. I am trustworthy. I do not tell
the secrets of anyone. I keep them.
Have confidence. Tell it to me. I Will
11ot reveal your secret."
The son: "My sickness has no rem-
edy."
esus: "Tell me about it; I Will rem-
edy it."
The son: "Because it has no remedy
it cannot be cured."
Jesus: "Tell it to me. I have the
remedy."
Theson: "For any kind of dis-
ease?"
Jesus: "Yes, for any kind of dis-
ease."
The son: am ashamed to tell you.
I a.m mortified to tell you."
Jesus: "Thou art my son."
The son, thinking for a moment, said:
cannot mention it with my tongue.
It seems to me that I Will be impo1it'e
if I do."
Jesus: Will forgive thee."
The son: am in love With the
daughter of the king who is in a city
nearby. My Work is the selling of
thorns-. What can I say more than
this?"
Jesus: "Have confidence. God Will-
ing I shall send thee what thou Wishest. 
Briefly, his Holiness arranged it for him
so that he might marry the young Woman.
On the night of the Wedding, just as he
entered her room, which was full
of ornaments and splendor, something
came to his mind and he said to him-
self, this person (Jesus) has brought
to consummation so great a matter for
mefor himself?
Inasmuch as he performed such good
fortune for me, he could have performed
the same thing, for himself. Yet Wit'l1
such ideal powers he Wanders in the des-
ert; he eats grass; he sleeps 011 the earth;
he sits in the dark; he is in the utmost
poverty. When this thought' came to
him he said to the young Woman: "Re-
main thou here. I have a little business
to att'end to; I go and Will return." He
Went out into the night in pursuit of his
Holiness. Finally he found him and
said: my Lord. Thou hast not
treated me fairly."
Jesus: "I/Vhy?"
Son: "Thou hast obtained for me
that which thou desired not for thyself.
Undoubtedly thou hast something which
is greater than this. And if this were
the acceptable thing thou Wouldst have
chosen it for t'hyself. It is evident thou

He followed him. Then his Holiness
Went to his disciples and said: have
found, in this village, a hidden treasure.
Now I have saved it. This is my treas-
ure. I have taken him out of the earth
and I give him to you."
One of those who were present said
