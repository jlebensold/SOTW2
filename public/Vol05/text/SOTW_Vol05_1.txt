seeare opened; The Sun of Truth is shining
upon the world; the Fountains of Lriie
are flowing; the Daysprings of Mercy have ap--
pear-ed; the Greatest and Most Glorious Light is 
now manifest to illuminate the hearts of men.
Wake up and hear the Voice of GOD calling .
from all parts of the Supreme unto
Me, ye children of men; come unto Me, ye
who are thirsty, and drink from this smeei I/Voter 
which is descending in iorrenis upon all parts of
the globe."
These clays are the clays of Faith and Deecls--~ 
not the clays of words ancl lip service: Let us I 
arise from the sleep of negligence, and realize what 
a great feast is prepared for us; first eating thereof 
ourselves, then giving unto others who are thirst~ 'l 
ing for the Wate-r of Knowledge, and hungering 
I for the Bread of Li-fe.
5 These'Great Days are swiftly passing; and once
gone they can never he recalled. So, While the
Rays of the Sun of Truth are still shining and The
Center of The Covenant of GOD is manifest, let
us go forth to work.
The Doors of the Kingdom
