 MASHRAK-EL-AZKAR IS THE FIRST DIVINE INSTITUTE
IN 
Through Dr. Fareed, to the Secretaries of the Convention of Delegates for
the Mashrak--el-Azkar, Charles Ioas and Gertrude Buikema, Chicago.
HE IS 
0 ye two candles of the Meeting of the Friends!
The secretary in the meeting of the spiritual ones must be shining as
a candle, for he is the medium for communicating thoughts and the explana-
tion of Mysteries.
Praise be to God that the Convention of the delegates for the Mashral<--
el--Azkar was held in perfect order and that the members assembled in that
spiritual meeting with radiant faces, heavenly hearts, merciful spirits and the
glad-tidings of the Kingdom, and consulted and deliberated respecting the
founding of the Mashraleel-Azkar.
Although hereafter thousands of will be founded, yet
as this Mashrak-el-Azkar is the first Divine Institute in America, therefore
it is very important and its results and fruits are endless. Soon will some of
its results become known and evident.
In brief: The delegates who congregated in that lordly Assemblage
and engaged in the service of the Divine Kingdom must give thanks night
and day, for they were thus aided and confirmed and left a "footprint"
(trace) of which eternality is an inherent quality.
Although the importance of this Divine Institute is not very evident now,
yet in the future it will be clear and plain as the sun.
Upon ye be BAHA--EL-ABHAI
ABBAS.
