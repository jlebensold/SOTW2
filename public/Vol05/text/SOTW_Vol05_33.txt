RAISE be to Thee, GOD of Names and Creator
of Heaven! Praise be to Thee, for Thou hast
made known unto Thy servants Thy Day, wherein
the River of Life streamed forth from theyfinger of
Thy, Generosity, and the Fountain of Revelation and Unity
became manifest by Thy Manifestation, to all who are in
Thy earth and Heaven.
0 This is a Day, the Light of which Thou hast
sanctified above the sun and its effulgence. . . . Thou
hast called it "The Day of God!" Nothing is to b-e seen
therein but Thy Supreme Self, and naught is to be remem-
bered save Thy sweetest Name. Wherefore. when He
appeared, the foundations of nations trembled, the learned
were bewildered and the wise men were confounded, save
those who came near unto Thee, took from the hand of
Favor the pure wine of Thy Inspiration, and drank in Thy
Name, saying 
"Praise be unto Thee, Desire of the nations! Praise
be to Thee, Beloved of the hearts of the yearning!"
