To the believers of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful, Phila-
delphia, upon them be 
HE IS 
ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom!
:5 *5 ye friends and maid-servants of the M;ercifull It is
easy to advance toward the Kingdom, bu-t it is diflicult to remain firm and
steadfast. Therefore, endeavor ye as much as ye can to make your faith
firm like unto a Well-rooted tree and produce blossoms and fruits. Neither
be ye agitated on account of the blowing winds of tests and trials. The
firmer the roots of the tree the greater its blossoms and fruits. Because
the Apostles of Christ remained firm and steadfast they became assisted
in the most great services and the confirmations of the Holy Spirit descended
upon them uninterruptedly.
If ye seek the illumination of the Kingdom ye must arise with infinite
resolution. Be ye not discouraged or lukewarm on account of troubles
and vicissitudes. Show ye an effort so that that region may be illumined,
the Kingdom of God may raise its tents and the breaths of the Holy Spirit
may quicken the souls.
(Signed) ABBAS.
