Supplication
To the Believers of God and the Maifl-servants of the Merciful,
Portland, Oregon.
Upon them be 
HE IS coo!
Thou Heavenly Father!
Thou hast the hosts of the Kingdom ancl the spiritual angels. We,
indigent souls are brokemwingecl birds; yet we yearn to soar toward the
immensity of the Kingdom. We are thirsty fish; we seek the Sea of the
Water of Life. We are the butterflies of the nether world; we long for
the Lamp of the Realm on High. We are in the utmost weakness and
feebleness; yet we are fighting against the armies of the worlcl. Therefore,
Lord of Hosts! confirm us so that the army of Light may become vic-
torious ancl the legions of the darkness be defeated. Assist us in the service
of the Kingdom and acquaint us with the Divine Mysteries. Rejoice us
with the glad-tidings of the everlasting sovereignty and bestow upon us a
portion and a share of the Life Eternal. Suffer the tongues to he unloosecl
ancl grant sight to the eyes; so that we may behold the world of the Kingdom
ancl may praise with an eloquent speech Thy Beauty and Thy Perfection.
Verily, Thou art the Bestower and the Kind!
