 ARE ALL THE FRUITS OF ONE TREE
AND THE LEAVES OF ONE BRANCH --Baha'o'llah






I
"This is THE BRANCH that
hath extended from the Bower of
Thy Oneness and from the TREE
of Thy Unity. Thou beholdest
Him, My GOD, gazing' unio
Thee and holding fast to the Rope
of Thy Providence. Preserve
Him in the neighborhood of Thy
Mercy!"
