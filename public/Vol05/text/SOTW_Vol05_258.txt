UNWERSAL PEACE TAIJGHT BY MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS AGO
The cause of Universal Peace was instituted in Persia in 1851 by
Baha'o'llah, the founder of the Bahai movement.
INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION
Baha'o'llah commanded the people to establish Universal Peace, and sum-
moned all the nations to the "divine banquet" of International Arbitration so that
questions of national honor, property, boundaries, and of all vital interests
between nations might be decided by an arbitral court of justice to which all
nations would pledge their allegiance.
INTERNATIONAL POLICE
Baha'o'llah also declared the necessity for International Police, that all the
countries might be freed from the need of arms and the diabolical inventions for the
destruction of the human race. Thus there would be need for only a few soldiers
indorder to assure the safety of the state, to punish offenders, and to prevent civil
se ition.
Abdul Baha, the present leader of the movement, during his travels in
Europe and America in 1910-1913 constantly called the people to the considera-
tion of Universal Peace. Today his words will be recalled by thousands who
heard him speak, for he predicted the present war, and declared Universal
Peace to be the most vital problem of the twentieth century.
PEACE THE HOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM OF TI-IE AGE
"Why should this great and important cause of Universal Peace, which is,
verily, like the sun among the lights of civilization, the cause of honor, freedom,
happiness and prosperity of all mankind, be considered as an ideal impossible of
realization. What cause could be greater than this? 
The Bahai Movement provides the spiritual dynamic which will insure
the permanency of Universal Peace.
