TQDAY in Persia there are assemblages
held wherein souls who have listened to
the teachings of repre~
senting l\/lohammedans, Christians, Jews,
Zoroastrians, Buddhists and the various denom-
inations of each, live together with perfect
accord and absolute agreement. There is
extraordinary brotherhood amongst them. A
wonderful love exists amongst them, and all of
them are a united force for international
peace.
