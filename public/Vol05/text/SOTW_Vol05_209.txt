"The Song of The Covenant"
The Divine Minstrel helci the stringed instrument in
His Hand, and preluded a melody and tune after the Persian
note, and sang this Song with a loud voice, as follows:
This is the Ancient Covenant!
This is the One Who has the Cup' in His Hand!
This is the One Who has hrought failure in the market of
the foseph of the Mercijrul "God!
This is the Testament of Accord!
This is a Covenant to hold to, and utterly detach one's self
from aught else!
This is the cause of stopping the cries of contradiction
(made by deniers) through the Divine Mercy!
This is the Pie-existent Covenant!
This is the weighty Mystery!
This is the Greatest Secret of the countenance oj 'E!-Baha
--May my soul redeem His beloved ones!
ABBAS.
