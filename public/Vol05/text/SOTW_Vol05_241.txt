IT IS self-evident that humanity is at variance.
Human tastes difler; thoughts, nativities, races
and tongues are various. The need of a
Collective Center, by which these differences
may be counterbalanced and the people of the
World be unified, is obvious. Consider how
nothing but a spiritual power can bring about
this unification; for material conditions and
mental aspects are so widely different that agree--
ment and unity are impossible through outer
means. But it is possible for all to become uni~
fiecl through Qne Spirit just as all may receive
light from one sun. . . . Today, His Holiness
is the Collective Center of
Unity for all humanity.
