Supplication
Cover the sins of the weak ones with the hem of the garment of Thy
Mercy! Change the indifference of the heedless ones into the essence of fidelity
wisdom and understanding! Grant the souls a loftier eflort and arouse an
other (spiritual) tumult in the minds so that they may sing the melody of the
Supreme Realm, seek for a Glory Everlasting, long for the delicacies of the
New World, soar toward the Brightest Horizon, enter the congregation of the
Almighty and become the recipients of the bestowals of the Kingdom! Thus
will the dark world become luminous, the satanic field transformed into the
courts of the Merciful, the mound of earth become the mound of Heaven and
the terrestrial globe the Eternal Rose-garden. Verily, Thou art the Power
ful, the Mighty, the Heater, the Seer!
(Signed) ABBAS.
