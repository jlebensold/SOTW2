AND WAR FROM THE FACE
OF THE 
ye heavenly ones!
Organize ye spiritual assemblies. Lay ye the
foundation of union and concord in this world. Destroy ye
the fabric of strife and war from the face of the earth.
Construct ye the temple of harmony and agreement. En-
lcindle ye the light of the realm of the oneness of humanity.
Open ye your eyes. Gaze and behold ye the Other
World. The Kingdom of Peace, Salvation, Uprightness
and Reconciliation is founded in the lnvisible World, and
it will by degrees become manifest and apparent through
the power of the Word of God. supplicate God that
ye may become the army of that Kingdom, in order that,
by the power of the Most Great Name, the friends of Cod
may conquer the world through love, friendship and the
strength of the Kingdom ol Peace, the human race may
become compassionate, and bloodshed and carnage be com-
pletely eflaced from the universe.
