THESE DREADFUL EVENTS are as
warnings on the part of God so that
they may quicken the people and make them
mindful. Like unto children, who are being
rocked in a cradle, the harder they are rocked
to be awakened, the deeper they fall into
sleep . . . . We shall wait and see what God
hath decreed to be the outcome of this uni-
versal upheaval . . . . Perchance, God Willing,
they may become mindful . . . . In short, pray
and supplicate at the Threshold of the Almighty
in behalf of the heedless souls, for they know
not what they are doing!
--ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
