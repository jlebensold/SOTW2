BAHAI TEMPLE UNITY CONVENTION
cr-ncaoo, APRIL 2s-2s, 1914
[Such a full, beautiful and spiritual report of the Convention was written by the new Secretary, Alfred
E. Lunt, and printed in the STAR or THE WEST, that so-me deemed it a sufficient report of the Convention
and that it'mighl: dispense with publishing a fuller or more formal report. However, so many inquiries
ha-ve come that a condensed formal report of the doings of the Convention has been prepared and is here-
with HE EnIroRs.]
HE friends, both delegates and vis-
ito-rs, were welcomed by the Chicago
Assembly on Saturday, April 25th., at the
Reception Room in the Great Northern Hotel
and at the home of Mrs. True. In the even-
ing, all gathered in the Feast of El--Rizwiin at
the Noontide Club, Michigan Avenue and
Twelfth 'Street.
On Sunday morning, April 26th, the friends
gathered on the Mashrak-el-Azkar grounds, in
the village of Wilmette, and, standing on the
spot hallowed by the presence and service of
the Beloved Abdul-Bahii, the vision of all the
friends was widened and their hearts moved
by the words of reco-rded in the
Surat-ul--Hykl concerning Abdul-Baha as the
Spiritual Temple, read by Mr. Hall. It was
a place and time of spiritual transfiguration.
Sunday afternoon a public meeting of friends
and visitors that filled St. _Tohn's Hall in the
Masonic Temple was presided over by Mr.
Charles H. Greenleaf. He read from the Words
of and delivered an address upon
Unity and the significance and purpose of the
Mashrak-el-Azkiir. Short and effective ad-
dresses were made by Mr. Alfred E. Lunt,
Mr. William H. Hoar, Mrs. Marian Haney,
Mr. Louis G. Gregory, Mr. Edward B. Kin-
ney, Mrs. Kate Ives, Mrs. Claudia Coles, Mrs.
Mabel Geary and Mr. Albert H. Hall. The
congregation was greatly moved by the sing-
ing in unison and also by the solos sung by
Madame Linne.
The address of Mrs. Haney was a compre-
hensive statement of the Message, and it is
hoped it will be published for the benefit both
of those who heard it and for future service
in the Cause.

the Hope of the lovers, to make us pure and without
desire, following Thy Command and leaving our de-
lights to seek Thy Good Pleasure. God, adorn us
with the Robe of Thy Virtues and illumine us with the
Light_ of severance. Assist us, God, with the hosts
of and utterance, that we may spread Thy
