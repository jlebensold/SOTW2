TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
thou Star of -the West! ms 1s con!
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long, thou shalt
become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper of the
Bahais which is organized in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are limited,
thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakable, become the object of the attention
of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the Covenant, in the
future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto the waves of the sea; thy volume will increase. thy
arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will be raised and become world-wide--and at last
thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these _depend upon firmness, firmness.
firmness! (Signed) Asnun-Bum Amms.

that God will unite the East and the West
in order that these two civilizations shall be
exchanged and mutually enjoyed. I am sure
it will come to pass for this is the Radiant
Century. This is an age for the outpouring
of Divine Mercy upon the exigency of this new
century,--the unity of the East and the West.
It will surely be accomplished.
