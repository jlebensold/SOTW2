The nations of Europe are at war with each other as we go to press. This issue of the
STAR or THE has been compiled with that calamity in mind. THE Emroas
GREAT SHALL 
PRAISE be to God that thou hast attained! . . .
Thou hast come to see ta prisoner and an exile
. . . We desire but the good of the world and
happiness of the nations; yet they deem us a stirrer up
of strife and sedition worthy of bondage and banish~
ment. . . . That all nations should become one in
faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection
and unity between the sons of men should be strength-
ened: that the diversity of religion should cease, and
differences of race be annuled--what harm is there in
this? Yet so it shall be; these fruitless strifes, these
ruinous wars shall pass away, and the "Most Great
Peace" shall come. . . . Do _not you in Europe need
this also? Is not this that which Christ foretoldsee your kings and rulers lavishing their
treasures more freely on means for the destruction of
the human race than on that which would conduce to
the happiness of mankind. . . . These strifes and this
bloodshed and discord must cease, and all men be as
one kindred and one family. . . Let not a man glory
in this, that he loves his country; let him rather glory
in this, that he loves his kind.
