STAR OF THE WEST 163
of Baha must needs be distinguished
from others in all respects, until they
become the lamps of the True One
among the creatures, and the stars of
Guidance shining from the Supreme
Concourse.

THE GREATEST OF THE GIFTS OF
GOD
Through Mr. Thornton Chase, Thahbet
--Upon him be the
maid-servant of God, Mrs. Cecilia
Harrison.
thou maid-servant of the Kingdom!
Thy service in the Kingdom of God is
known and thy troubles in serving the
Cause of God are evident and apparent.
This is the greatest of the gifts of
God, that in such a blessed age and holy
century thou shouldst raise thy voice in
the Kingdom of God and invite people
to the holy mountain of the Lord of
Hosts.
Soon thou shalt see that on account
of the bounties of the Kingdom thou
didst become the cause of guidance to
others, and by the grace of the Lord
Almighty thou hast surpassed the
queens of the world. Thou shalt see
eternal honor; thou shalt find everlast-
ing life; thou shalt see the world il-
lumined with the light of great guid-
ance.
dear maid-servant of God!
All the people, day and night, are
Working and striving and have no leis-
ure at all; but in the end they will be
disappointed and deprived; the effect of
their efforts will be obliterated, and
with the utmost loss and chagrin they
depart from this world and do not re-
ceive any value for this life. But, on
the other hand, the sons and daughters
of the Kingdom will ultimately become
burning lights and will be as shining
stars in the horizon of eternal honor.
Therefore, thank thou God that thou
didst arrive at this station.
Upon thee be Baha-el-Abha!
(Signed) ABBAS.

WITH A RESOUNDING VOICE
TEACH THE CAUSE
thou herald of the Kingdom of God!
Thy letter was received. A thou-
sand times, Bravo! for thy high magna-
nimity and exalted aim! Trusting in
God and While turning thy face toward
the Kingdom of Abha, unfurl thou the
Divine Flag in Tokyo and cry at the
top of thy voice: ye people! The
Sun of Reality hath appeared and flood-
ed all the regions With its glorious
Lights; it has upraised the Standard of
the Oneness of the World of Humanity
and summoned all mankind to the re-
fulgent Truth. The cloud of mercy is
pouring; the zephyr of providence is
wafting and the World of humanity is
being stirred and moved. The Divine
Spirit is conferring Eternal Life, the
heavenly lights are illumining the hearts 
the table of the sustenance of the King-
dom is spread and is adorned with all
kinds of foods and victuals! ye con-
course of men! Awake! Awake! Be-
come mindful! Become mindful! Open
ye the seeing eyes, unstop the hearing
ears. Hark! Hark! The soft notes of
heavenly music are streaming down,
ravishing the ears of the people of spir-
itual discernment. Ere long this trans-
cendent Light will wholly enlighten the
'East and the West."
In short, with a resounding voice,
with a miraculous power and with the
magnetism of the Love of God, teach
them the Cause of God, and rest thou as-
sured that the Holy Spirit shall confirm
thee. . .

Bahais in Japan: Diary of Mirza
