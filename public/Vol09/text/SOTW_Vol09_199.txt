table. This is one of the greatest be-
stowals of the Almighty. Thank thou
God for it, because thou art confirmed
therein. Convey my utmost kindness to
the attracted maid-servant of God, Mrs.
Krug. It is a long time that we have
heard no news from her. Of late, we
received the news that her daughter has
the intention of marriage. We hope
that this marriage will be a blessed one!

POST CARD TO DENVER
Haifa, Palestine,
December 2, 1918.
Dear brothers and sisters:
The friends in Colorado are especially
remembered by the Beloved, and to them
he conveys his noble Abha greeting. He
desires them to be the promoters of good-
fellowship amongst all the nations of the
world and the torch bearers of unity be-
tween the disunited children of men.
Like unto the Rocky Mountains they
must raise their heads above the low
plains of human thought. They must
be the cause of the descent of the rain
of mercy upon the dark and barren des-
ert of humanity, suffering the hard
hearts to be covered with verdure, blos-
soms and fruits.
Are you able to render this service
to the Cause of your Master?
Ahmad Sohmb.
In brief, that dear daughter is always
remembered. I pray in thy behalf, that
day by day thou mayest become more
illumined and draw more nigh unto the
Kingdom of God.
Convey longing greeting to all the be-
lievers and the maid-servants of the Mer-
ciful. 
Upon thee be greeting and praise!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.

POST CARD TO ST. LOUIS
Haifa, Palestine,

My dear brothers and sisters:
The Bahais are members of one uni-
versal community and the children of
the Beloved. He is the kind father to
all and he sends you his noble Abha
greeting hoping that you may so purify
your hearts as to receive the more subtle
and spiritual emotions of the Kingdom
of Abha. You must become very sensi-
tive to the sufferings and woes of hu-
manity and then find proper ways of
their alleviation. Like unto the clear
mirror your hearts must reflect the
higher and nobler sentiments of this new
age and your ears be so attuned as to
listen to the music of the invisible choir.
Then you are the true servants and maid-
servants of the Lord of Lords.
Ahmad Sohrab.

ye who are enkindled with the fire
of the love of God!
Ever do I inhale the fragrance of
faithfulness from the rose-garden of the
hearts of the believers and I was filled
with joy at the receipt of the good news
of the prosperity and success of that
merciful community and their humility
and submission towards the Cause of
God.
Verily, I received a letter from his
honor Aga Mohamad Taki, giving the
glad-tidings that the friends are in the
utmost of joy and fragrance. Spiritual
emotions are ever stirred in my heart
and the rays of their remembrance and
the heat of their love are continually re-
flected in my soul. I supplicate at the
threshold of the Supreme Lord to make
them the signs of guidance amongst
mankind and as brilliant lamps scatter-
ing their lights to all the regions . . . .
