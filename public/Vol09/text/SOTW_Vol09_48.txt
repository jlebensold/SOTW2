TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
thou Star of the West! HE IS cool
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long, thou shalt
become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper of the
Bahais which is organized in the country oi America. Although for the present thy subscribers are limited,
thy form_ is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshalgable, become the_object of the attention
of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the Covenant, in the
future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto the waves of_ the sea; thy volume will increase,
thy arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will be raised and become world-w1de--and at
last thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these_depend upon firmness, firniness,
firmness! (Signed) Aliens.

Chairman Dr. D-'Eve1yn: think We
might now have a report from Mr. Ober,
the secretary, covering our other activ-
ities."
Mr. Ober: "The most important re-
ports brought to the Convention are those
which show the actual deeds and accom-
plishments in the Way of raising this
initial fund of from $200,000 to
$300,000. At the most, the report of
the Secretary merely outlines the meet-
ings and the various consultations which
were--n0 doubt, through the assistance

of Abdul-Baha--permitted to stimulate
this gathering. It appears that every one
of us should be in the condition of ut-
most thankfulness and rejoicing over the
tremendous response that has been made
during the past year; for it shows, more
than anything else, how deep down in
the hearts of the believers is the longing
irrespective of all outer conditions in the
World of existence, in the Cause of God,
to fulfill completely the exhortations of
Abdul-Baha, and to raise the required
fund so that this Work may be done in
his day, so that the cornerstone, the
actual beginning of the wonderful edifice
of God, the Mashrekol-azkar, can be
completed here in Wilmette by the
blessed hands of the Center of the Cov-
enant himself. The response to the
Building Fund Committee's letter in
October Was certainly Wonderful and ex-
traordinary; and it Would appear that
there needs to be one more really mighty
effort in order to establish the treasury
at the minimum that Abdul-Baha has
required, in order that We may cable
him, or send Word to him, that We have
fulfilled his requirements; and, When We
do that, how do We know of the effect
it Will have upon the conditions of the
entire universe?
"The proof, in the past, of steadfast-
ness, was Words, but today Baha'o'llah
