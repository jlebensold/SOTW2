Charles Ioas was born in Munich, Ger-
many, on March 23rd, 1859. He passed
through the regular elementary courses
of study and graduated from the Uni-
versity of Munich in 1880. The same
year he came to America, studied law,
and thereafter followed that vocation.
He received the glorious message of the
appearance of Baha'o'llah and the Cen-
ter of the Covenant, in 1898, and im-
mediately dedicated his life and being
to the Cause of God. He was one of the
first members of the House of Spiritual-
ity and served thereon for many years.
His body rests in Mount Auburn Cem-
etery.

GE CRGE LE SCH
EORGE LESCH,
one of the best
known servants in the
Bahai Cause in America,
passed from the world of
the seen to the realm of
the unseen, at Chicago,
April 8th, 1918. He was
one of the first in the occident to hear of
and accept the message of the Kingdom,
devoting his life in service to the Center
of the Covenant.
In the minds and hearts of those who
knew him, his name will ever be syn-
onymous with trustworthiness, sincer-
ity and faithfulness. He was the first
secretary of the House of Spirituality,
serving in that capacity for many years.
It was upon his return home, about mid-
night, from a business meeting, to ar-
range for the recent Mashrekol-azkar
Convention, that he was stricken with
apoplexy and died soon after, with the
Greatest Name upon his lips.
In the public meetings, when he spoke
before the people, the two subjects
which he was ever fond of presenting
Were "Prayer" and "The power of the
Holy Spirit."
George Lesch was born at Chicago,
December 27th, 1866. His body rests in
Graceland Cemetery.
A TRIBUTE FROM HIS CO-WORKERS, THE
HOUSE OF SPIRITUALITY.
Chicago, Illinois.
Miss Mary Lesch, Chicago.
Dear sister in El-Baha:
The members of the House of Spir-
ituality, at a meeting held Thursday
evening, April 11th, desired to express
to you their sympathy in the pass-
ing of your dear brother and our re-
spected co-worker, George Lesch.
We realize that no words of ours can
eulogize him, and that any attempt to do
so would be entirely inadequate. Rec-
ognizing the great love that existed be-
tween you, our love for you both gives
us the privilege to share with you his
memory and to keep it sacred in our
hearts as it undoubtedly will be in the
hearts of posterity.
His faithfulness, sincerity and sacri-
fice in the path of God were known to
all. It is an honor to be associated with
such an one whose whole life was one of
faithful service, who was steadfast
under the most severe tests and "en-
dured until the end."
Our greatest hope is that we all may
serve as devotedly as did he the blessed
Cause that we all love.
Your sisters and brothers of
THE or SPIRITUALITY,
Carl Schefiler, Secretary.
