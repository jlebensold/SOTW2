JAMES HANBY
"James Hanby
died on board ship
June 16, 1918." This
brief Word was re-
ceived in Chicago
some Weeks later. \Ve
understand he was
enroute to Europe en-
listed to serve the
Canadian overseas
forces.
Mr. Hanby served the Bahai Cause
in Chicago. Those who attended the
Centennial Celebration of the Birth of
this city will remember
him especially for his activity at the
banquet in the Auditorium Hotel. This
was a distinctive characteristic he pos-
sessed, so much so, that before he heard
of the Bahai a press
agent for Well-known turf was
called "Busy Jimmy." He was known
from coast to coast in those days, and
we believe he will be long remembered
for his brief but energetic service among
the Bahais in Chicago.
 
DR. CLAUDE F. LATHROP AND
GEORGE LUTHER.
Seattle, Washington,
February 7, 1919.
To the STAR or THE 
The hosts of the Supreme Concourse
were stirred by the ascension of two
devoted Bahai souls, Dr. Claude F. La-
throp and Mr. George Luther, on the
night of December 18, 1918.
Contracting pneumonia following in-
fluenza about the same day, they passed
out within a few hours of each other.
THE WEST
Dr. Lathrop had served the Cause
of with tireless devotion
for ten years, half of that time With-
standing the keenest physical suffering.
He gloried in his tests feeling that he
was greatly blessed. He worked over
the sick until the last, literally treading
the path of to aid suffering
humanity.
His loss is keenly felt by the Seattle
believers and his wife and two children
have the love and sympathy of all in
this sad but exalted hour.
Mr. George Luther, husband of Mrs.
Laura Luther, and brother-in-law to
Mrs. Mabel Geary of Seattle, and Mrs.
Effie Snyder of Spokane, was an earnest,
firm believer, living the life quietly but
faithfully. He, with his Wife, had lived
for eleven years on their ranch at Omak,
Wash, and were the only lights in that
region. Their perseverance in sowing
the seed was beautiful. His new birth
into the higher Kingdom was attended
by chanting a.nd offering praises to God,
raising the call of 
till all were illumined by the presence of
the spirit.
A unity funeral was held and the two
brothers in El-Abha. were laid side by
side.
Impressive passages from the Hidden
orcls were read by a maid-servant and
prayers were offered by one of the
servants.
Real unity of the friends was at-
tained through this double sorrow, for
spiritual uplift and exultation attended
the occasion, robbing it of the usual
gloom. Thus "death" was made a glad
tidings for all.
