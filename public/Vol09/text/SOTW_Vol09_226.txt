Eng., where he died October 7th.
[The following letters, beginning with
his m0ther's brief note to the STAR or
THE WEST and ending with the words of
Abdul-Baha. in a, Tablet just received,
are more than at memorial to Erwin
Harris, for they epitomize the supreme
sacrifices of just such mothers and sons
everywhere, as well as the olivine com;
fort which goes out unto _all from the
Great Heart of Edi-
tors.]
Note from his mother:
To the STAR or THE 
Your kind letter just reached me;
many thanks. I don't know what to
write, so will enclose these letters and
you can use your judgment. He was a
sweet, wonderful boy and gave his life
willingly for what he thought was right
and we are very proud of him. I saved
all of his letters and they bear witness
that he was spiritually awakened. He
would be 19 years old, April 25th, 1919.
. . . . The physical separation was
hard, but Abdul-Baha has healed the
wound.
Hastily,
Gertruele Harris.

My dear Mother:
Received your letter tonight, and was
very glad to hear from you. I am very
sorry that you do not feel well. Dear
Mother, you know how to look on deathpainted. I am
not afraid of death and I know that you
are not. Even if you leave us, I know
that you will always be with me, and
some day I will be a credit to you and
to the rest of them. This may sound a
little hard-hearted and cold, but I do
not mean it to be, it is straight from the
heart. Today is your birthday, and I
have not forgotten it. I can't send you
anything but my love. I really hope that
some day I may understand the Bahai
faith and that I will be able to make
the rest of the world believe in it. . . .
I have learned a lot since I have been
in the army and I have met men from
all walks of life. I have not gone down.
I l1ave gone up, both mentally and
physically, and I believe that later 011 in
life this will all be a great help to me.
I don 't drink nor smoke, and believe me,
Mother, I never will, so don 't worry
about that (something is in me, Mother,
and some day it will pop out), and you
will see it whether you are on this earth
or not.
are going to leave here very soon.
I think we will either go to Camp Mer-
ritt or Camp Mills and we will be there
within ten days, and I will see you
Mother, before I go overhave not an enemy in the company
and few Corporals can say that. The
men in my squad will do anything for
me, and that is the way it will have to
be later. People will have to believe
in me. I will have to make them love
me. Unless they love you, you can't do
anything with them, you can 't make
them believe in you till you make them
love you, can you? I don't understand
just what it is all about but I know
something tells me that it is all for some-
thing wonderful.
\Vrite to me soon.
With love,
Erwin.

Dear Mother:
My last letter to you was written in a
rest camp, but now I am writing from
a much dilferent place. Soon after my
letter we went back up the line, and I
