Z00 STAR OF THE WEST
TABLET TO PERSIA
thou kind friend and spreader of
truth!
The eloquent letter of your honor re-
ceived and its contents imparted the ut-
most joy, that, praise be to God, this
unique newspaper is still being pub-
lished, showing firmness and steadfast-
ness and during the past years of revo-
lution and commotion it failed not nor
was it discontinued. It is hoped that it
may become a center through which great
and general services may be rendered
to the World of humanity. Praise be to
God, that although in the past few years
many newspapers stopped their publica-
tion, this newspaper, which is a well-
wisher, remained firm and its issue Was
not brought to a close.
Should you inquire concerning the
conditions of these exiled ones, praise be
to God, that notwithstanding thousands
of afflictions we are kept safe and
guarded in the Fortress of Divine Pro-
tection. Verily, this is a most miracu-
lous matter!
Although the booming of cannons and
the terrific noises of machine guns had
thrown the world into utter commotion
and earthquake in Europe and America,
the voices of the members of this com-
munity were raised, encouraging men to
the ideal of universal peace. Many arti-
cles were published in the newspapers
that the great, final result of this war
would not be bad for Persia. The various
political parties in Persia, such as the
party of Liberty, the Revolutionary
party, the Democratic party, the Union-
ist party, in brief, all these and other
parties brought ruin upon that country.
But, God willing, ere long these exiled
ones will be assisted to render a most
great service to Persia and the Persians,
because We are taking hold of every
effective means and are connected with
important personages.
LETTER ACCOMPANYING THESE
TABLETS
Haifa, Palestine,
December 16, 1918.
Mr. Joseph H. Hannen,
Washington, D. C.
My dear brother oseph:
Lately two Tablets have been revealed
from the pen of the Center of the Cove-
nant, the translations of which I would
like to share with you and the friends.
The first is addressed to the believers
in Cairo and Port Said, and the second
is written to the Editor of a Persian
newspaper . . . .
. .
I am,
Ever your faithful brother,
Ahmad Sohrab.
"Unloose the tongue in teaching the Cause of God"
WORDS OF ABDUL-BAHA
As much as you are able, unloose the
tongue in teaching the Cause of God
and demonstrate ye extraordinary effort
in the guidance of the souls. The Cause
of God will advance only through the
effect of teaching and the friends will
achieve victory through the holy fra-
grances. I declare by the mystery of
existence that were there a number of
souls to arise, opening their tongues
and delivering the Message with the ut-
most severance, sanctification, holiness
and power of attraction the powers of
the world would not withstand them and
the hosts of the earth would not pre-
vent them from accomplishing their
tasks.
(From the Diary of Mirza Ahmad
Sohrab-, June 25, 1914.)
