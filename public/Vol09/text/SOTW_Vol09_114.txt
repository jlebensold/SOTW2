Mighty, and Thou art the Wise, the
Seer!

my God! my God! Thou seest
these children, branches of the tree of
life, birds of the garden of safety, pearls
of the shells of the ocean of Thy mercy
and roses of the rose-garden of Thy guid-
ance.
Lord! Verily we glorify Thy praise,
sanctify Thee and supplicate to the
Kingdom of Thy mercifulness to make
us candles of guidance, stars of the hori-
zon of the Eternal Majesty among the
creatures; and teach us from Thy knowl-
edge, Glory of the Most Glorious_!

Zia M. Bagdadi, Feb. 23, 1911.)
PRAYERS TO MEMORIZE AND
USE.
Thou pure God! I am a little child;
make Thou the bosom of Thy gift a dear
resting place of comfort; suffer me to
grow and be nurtured with the honey
and milk of Thy love and train me under
the breast of Thy knowledge. Bestow
Thou freedom While in a state of child-
hood and grant Thou excellence.
Thou Incomparable One! Make me
the confidant of the Kingdom of the un-
seen! Verily, Thou art the Mighty and
the Powerful!
(Little book of prayers.)
unequaled Lord! For this helpless
THE WEST
child be a protector! For this weak and
sinful one be kind and forgiving.
Creator! Although we are but use-
less grass, yet we are of Thy garden.
Though We are but young trees, bare of
leaves and blossoms, yet we are of Thy
orchard.
Therefore nourish this grass with the
rain of Thy bounty, refresh and vivify
these young, languishing trees with the
eternal springtime.
Awaken us, enlighten us, give us
eternal life and accept us in Thy king-
dom.
(Little book of prayers.)
my Lord! my Lord! I am a
child of tender years; nourish me from
the breast of Thy mercy, train me in the
bosom of Thy love, educate me in the
school of Thy guidance and develop me
under the shadow of Thy bounty. De-
liver me from darkness; make me a
brilliant light. Free me from unhap-
piness; make me a flower of the rose-
garden. Suffer me to become a servant
of Thy threshold and confer upon me the
disposition and nature of the righteous
ones. Make me a cause of bounty to
the human World and crown my head
with the diadem of eternal life!
Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the
Mighty, the Seer, the I-Iearer!
(Little book of prayers.)
God! Guide me, protect me, illu-
mine the lamp of my heart and make me
a brilliant star.
Thou art the Mighty and Powerful.
(In Tablet to Mrs. E. O.)
loving God! I am a young child, a
suppliant, a captive. Be Thou my refuge,
my support, my protector. I am in dis-
tress: give me the means of tranquillity.
I am needy: bestow upon me the treas-
ure of the Kingdom. I am dead: give
me the spirit of life. I am Weak: favor
