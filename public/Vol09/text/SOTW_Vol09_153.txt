"We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations; that all nations shall become one in
faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of afiection and unity between the sons of men shall be strength-

FIRST TABLET REVEALED FOR AMERICAN BAHAIS SINCE THE

news, no letter and no greeting, but the ideal relations have been
strong and unshakable.
From the rose-garden of the hearts of the friends we inhaled
sweet and perfurning fragrances. This was indeed conducive to
the consolation of the souls.
Now, praise be to God, the road of correspondence is already
wide open and ere long the means of meeting will become avail-
able. Therefore, I engage myself in writing this epistle, address-

absent, though present spiritually.

tablets of His Highness more than fifty years ago,
are in these days revealed and unfolded. Read those tablets,
especially the Epistle of the Temple (S'm"at'ul H/Jkl) and the
tablets to the kings and rulers of the earth!
Consider ye! What greater miracle is there than this!
