carded and modern politics founded on peace raise
the standard of victory; the new star shine and
gleam and the new sun illumine and radiate; new
flowers bloom; the new spring become known; the
new breeze blow; the new bounty descend; the new
tree give forth new fruit; the new voice become
raised and this new sound reach the ears, that the
new may follow the new, and all the old furnish-
ings and adornments be cast aside and new decora-
tions put in their places.
I desire for you all that you may have this great
assistance and partake of this great bounty, and
that in spirit and heart you may strive and en-
deavor until the world of war become the world of
peace; the world of darkness the world of light;
satanic conduct be turned into heavenly behavior;
the ruined places become built up; the sword be
turned into the olive branch; the flash of hatred
become the flame of the love of God and the noise
of the gun the voice of the Kingdom; the soldiers
of death the soldiers of life; all the nations of the
world one nation; all races as one race; and all
national anthems harmonized into one melody.
Then this material realm will be paradise, the
earth heaven, and the world of satan become the
world of angels.
