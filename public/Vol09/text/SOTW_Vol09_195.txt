STAR OF THE WEST 195
to attend to my Beloved 's services after
having completed my course of Arts and
Sciences in the American University at
Beirut. I am so anxious and expectant
to hear from you and of your services
to the Cause for by transmitting them
to the Beloved I shall make him happy,
glad and strong.
The past four years have been years
of untold calamity, of unprecedented op-
pression, of indescribable misery, of se-
vere famine and distress, of unparal-
leled bloodshed and strife, but now that
the dove of peace has returned to its
nest and abode a golden opportunity has
arisen for the promulgation of the "lord
of God. This will be now promoted and
the Message delivered in this liberated
region without the least amount of re-
striction. This is indeed the Era of
Service.
You have undoubtedly done a large
amount of work in this respect and the
Beloved is eagerly awaiting its fascinat-
ing and pleasing account.
Hoping I shall hear from you and
from the dear friends,
I remain, your brother in the Cause,
Shogi.
LETTER FROM W. TUDOR-POLE
Cairo, Egypt,
December 8, 1918.
Dear Lotfullah:
Very many thanks for your letter of
November 3rd, contents of which I will
pass on to Abdul-Baha in due course.
The cables you sent have been for-
warded to Haifa, and I have just re-
turned from a visit to the Master in
Haifa and in Acca. I have written out a
full report of this and it will be sent you
from my sister probably soon after you
receive this letter. This report will give
you all the news, and I will write you
further when less rushed.
I am very glad to hear of your present
valuable and interesting work, and am
sure that you could not be doing better
things at the present time.
The postal mails are now open to Pal-
estine and letters and cables may be sent
direct from England and America to
Haifa, and there is no longer need to
post through Port Said. Please remem-
ber me very kindly to all friends. \Yith
best wishes, believe me,
Yours most sincerely,
W. Tudor-Pole.
P. S.--The Master is vigorous and
more healthy than when he was in Lon-
don. He sent his loving greetings to all
friends in England and America. I hope
he will come down here soon, as the
weather is getting cold in Haifa (where
there is no real want) . . . .
..I took a
Warm Persian cloak to the Master, and
am so glad I thought of it, because he
had no cloak at all.

LETTER FROM SHOGI EEFENDI
FORWARDED BY W. TUDOR-POLE
(Letter addressed to Major W. Tudor-
Pole, at Cairo, Egypt, by Shogi Effendi,
the grandson of Abdul-Baha.)
Haifa, Palestine,
December 17, 1918.
My dear spiritual brother:
Your long-expected letter was heartily
welcomed, so glad was the Beloved Ab-
dul-Baha to hear from you and through
you to know that the friends were all
Well. In fact, a few days ago, when the
Beloved was paying a visit to Colonel
Staunton, the Military Governor, Cap-
tain Kerr, being in his presence, was
asked whether he had any news from
you, to which he replied affirmatively.
I conveyed your message of love and
gratitude to the Master, and we all look
forward to the time of meeting you in
Haifa, this time we hope more fully.
The Beloved 's health is excellent, and he
reveals these days different Tablets to
Persia, Europe and America. Two Tab-
lets have been revealed for England, the
latter for Dr. Esslemont, Whose suppli-
