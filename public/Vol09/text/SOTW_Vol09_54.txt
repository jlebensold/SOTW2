The Chairman: "Now, shall we listen
to the report of the Publications Com-
mittee'? This committee, as you know,
was one, perhaps the only committee
which was authorized by Abdul-Baha to
be named in the annual conventions.
Therefore, it is appropriate that the
committee should report to you each
year; and then I suppose, in accordance
with the tablet, you should renew the
authority, or renew the committee, or
otherwise arrange for a committee -to
continue the work. Miss Masson, Chair-

and see who are here."

appointment of a Publications Commit-
tee. I will also read the letter from the
Secretary of the 1917 Convention."
Miss Masson then read the tablet and
letter above referred to, following with
a statement about the high standard
which should be raised for Bahai liter-
ature, in regard to truth, facts, literary
excellence, etc. The literature should be
an evidence of the perfection of the
Cause.
Miss Masson then reported with some

had been submitted, some poems and a
letter. The committee suggested that it
