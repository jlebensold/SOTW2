poor, as tl1e rich can help the poor here.
I11 every World all are the creatures of
God; They are always dependent upon
Him, not independent, nor can they
ever be so. While they are needful of
God, the more they supplicate, the richer
they become. "That is their merchandise?
What is their Wealth? In the other World
What is the means of help and assistance'?
It is intercession. First, undeveloped
souls must gain progress through the
supplications of the spiritually rich;
afterwards, they can progress through
their own supplications."
In Mernoriam
DR. JAMES F. CARMICHAEL
Dr. James F. Car-
michael passed to his
true home, December
6th, 1918, at p.
m. at the home of his
sister, Mrs. (Colonel)
D. Spence at Brant-
ford, Canada, after
three years suffering
with neuritis. VVhile
suffering terrible
pains he would exclaim with a smile:
and Abdul-Baha will
take care of me." The Most Great
Name always brought relief.
The moment he heard of the Revela-
tion-May, 1899-he accepted and re-
mained a firm believer under the most
severe tests. The heavenly light that
spread over his face as his soul took its
upward flight was startling and seen by
all. Strangers and friends exclaimed
alike: see the light!" His widow
a11d four sisters survive. He received
several wonderful Tablets from A.bdul-
Baha. The following is a11 extract from
a recent Tablet received by Mrs. Car-
michael in answer to a supplication
written by her prior to Dr. Carmichael 's
passing, but which was revealed after
his ascension:
"Concerning What you have written
about your dear husband, be thou not
grieved for, praise be to God, he has at-
tained unto everlasting life and has
reaped the fruit of his existence 011
earth, and this is faith and the complete
turning of the face toward the Kingdom
of God. This is verily everlasting
health; this is eternal comfort; this is
heavenly exaltation and this is merciful
bounty."
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.

GEORGE P. PARMERTON
On April 26, 1918, Mr. Parmerton of
Cincinnati, Ohio, passed from this world.
He had been in poor health for several
years and the last year was one of great
suffering endured with heroic patience.
His love for the Center of the Covenant
and the Greatest Name sustained him.
On Sunday evening, the Bahai friends
assembled at the home and the Bahai
service for the dead was beautifully con-
ducted in all simplicity; on Monday, in
Spring Grove Chapel, the Presbyterian
service was given and all that was mortal
laid to rest in that beautiful cemetery.
Abdul-Baha revealed the following to
him:
thou revered beloved!
Glad tidings be unto thee for thy firm-
ness in the strong Covenant. \Vith up-
rightness thou shalt obtain great victory.
Verily, thy Lord confirmeth the firm
