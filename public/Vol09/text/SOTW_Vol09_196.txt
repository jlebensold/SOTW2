196 STAR OF THE WEST
cation I translated yesterday for the
Master. I quote fully this Tablet:
TABLET
To his honor Dr. Esslemont--Upon him
be greeting and praise!
thou lover of all mankind!
Verily, have I chanted thy verses of
praise to God, inasmuch as He hath il-
lumined thine eyes with the light of
guidance, the light of the oneness of the
World of humanity; so much so that thy
heart overfiowed with the love of God
and thy spirit was attracted by the fra-
grance of God, and I supplicatc divine
Providence that thou mayest become a
torch to that gathering, so that the light
of knowledge might shine out from thee,
that thou mayest be confirmed to act in
accordance with the significances of the
Hidden Words and strengthened by God
under all circumstances.
Concerning the book you are editing,
send me a copy thereof. Con-
vey my greetings to the respected maid-
servant of Godpray the Lord to support thee in
the service of all humankind, irrespec-
tive of race or religion. Nay rather, thou
shouldst deal with all according to the
teachings of which are like
unto life to this Glorious Age.
Upon thee be greeting and praise!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
The Beloved was very glad to hear
from Miss Rosenberg, whose letter you
had sent but without any supplication
of yours enclosed. I wonder whether
you enclosed any supplication or not.
The Master a few days ago was invited
by Colonel Staunton to assist at a meet-
ing of the different religious heads of
Haifa, to institute a relief work for the
poor of Haifa. The Beloved responded
and then after many discussions, when
the time of donation came, the Governor
announced that although a poor man,
yet he would give five English pounds
for each of the three religious denomina-
tions. Major Nott followed with nine,
then publicly and directly the Governor
declared that he had the honor of an-
nouncing that His Excellency Abbas
Effendi (Abdul-Baha) had kindly given
the noble sum of fifty Egyptian pounds
for the poor, at which all present
clapped. Quite a high standard for the
Mufti and the Archbishop of Haifa to
follow.
The Master uttered the final Word of
prayer at a public and immense gather-
ing just given to celebrate the end of
the war. This is the text of the prayer:
PRAYER
Omnipotent God! Verily, the pa-
vilion of Justice has been raised in the
Holy Land, extending from East to
West. thank Thee and we praise
Thee for the establishment of this just
and equitable Sovereignty, and this
mighty Government which strives for the
comfort of its people and the safety of
its subjects. Almighty God! Con-
firm the Greatest Emperor George V,
through Thy divine confirmations, and
strengthen him by Thy merciful power,
and perpetuate his protecting shadow
upon this noble land. This we ask
through Thy help, assistance and pro-
tection. Verily, Thou art the Omnipo-
tent, the Exalted, the Omniscient and
the Generous!
Space forces me to stop, awaiting your
news.
Yours very faithfully,
Shogi Rcbbam/i.

Dear Lotfullah:
Above will interest you . . . .
..I have
been able to secure the sympathetic sup-
port of the British Governors of Haifa
and Acca for the Master, and as you will
see he is now treated with due respect
and asked to take part in the life of the
country . . . .
