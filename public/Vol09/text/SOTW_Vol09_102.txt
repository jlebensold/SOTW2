INTERPRETA-
TION OF A DREAM
young girl became evident to me
as belonging With the family, but I
could not make out who she was. She
spoke of a horse that my son had had
long ago, but I did not understand what
-she meant. After a time it became
known that she was my daughter, and
I felt grieved to think that I had not
been conscious of her presence in all
the past years. She seemed not hurt,
but surprised that we did not under-
stand her. Just as I was waking, I
realized that she was our little baby
who had passed away over twenty-one
years ago, when nine months old." (End
of dream.)
Mrs. EUR added: "She was my
idol, and because I loved her so much, I
tried hard to put her out of my thought,
and the dream made me feel that We
should not do this."
Abdul-Baha interpreted it thus:
"That child is your trust within the
charge of God. She was a child when
she went, but you shall find her full
grown in the Kingdom of God. You
shall find her mature. You shall not
find her there as a child. You shall find
her perfect and mature.
"As to the horse once belonging to
your son, of which she spoke: Horsein
the dream means a wish. It shows that
your daughter has fulfilled her wish and
her desire, and that shows the loftiness
of her station. The wish is one in which
your son shared, but she attained to it.
It is my hope, God willing, that, he, too,
will attain to it."
Surprise was expressed that a child
of only nine months could have a wish,
and Abdul-Baha said: "The child was
born with a wish."
Mrs. was crying, and Abdul-
Baha continued: "Do not cry. Be
happy because you saw her, and you
saw her perfected. You must be happy.
She is your trust with God. You have
not lost her out of your hands. The
only difference is this; that you gave
her as a trust to God as a child, but you
will take her back as a full grown per-
son. I had a son who was four years
old, and when he died I did not at all
change my attitude. I gave my son to
God as a trust, and so at his death I did
not grieve."
Mrs. said: "But there is a dif-
ference, you gave your son to God, but
God takes ours."
Abdul-Baha replied: "It is the same
thing. In both cases it is a trust of
God."
Abdul-Baha said: "The cause of her
surprise' is you are crying;
your daughter would say: have a
good mother. She must be happy. Why
does she cry? I am surprised.' The
cause of her surprise is the thought
that you do not recognize her. She be-
longs to a realm in which everything
becomes mature, and she expected you
to see her in the state of perfection in
which she manifested herself to you;
but the fact that you looked at her in
this way, and that nowyou are crying
a proof of your not having recog-
nized her. For had you recognized her
in the dream, you would not be crying
now."
Relative to the comment of Mrs. -i
that she tried to put the child out of
her thoughts, Abdul-Baha saidcontrol when to forget one.
It is not good for one to try to forget
them. One must always remember
them."

of Abdul-Baha as correct.)
