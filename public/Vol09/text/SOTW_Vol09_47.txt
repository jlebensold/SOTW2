deposit of $87,647.72.
"So that in all we had with the check-
ing account and the certificates of de-
posit $101,134.47.
"Mr. Randall, who is the treasurer of
the Building Fund Committee, will give
you a report of other holdings beside
money. Although this, in the world's
history, has been the most frightful year
that has ever been known on this planet,
and although in our country financial
conditions have been very difficult, yet it
has been the most prosperous year in
the Mashrekol-azkar work that We have
ever had. During the year from April
1, 1917, to March 31, 1918, We have re-
ceived $75,922.91 besides the other hold-
ings Which the Building Fund Commit-
tee will report to you."
Chairman Dr. D'Evelyn: "You have
heard Mrs. True's report and it is a very
satisfactory and encouraging one. Mr.
Randall will supplement it now."
Mr. Randall: know you would
like to hear the results of the pledge
system, as I am speaking now for the
Building Fund Committee. The invita-
tion for the Bahais to contribute to the
Mashrekol-azkar Fund, brought 195
pledges, signed on the pledge cards. At
the present time 95 have been paid in
full, there are yet remaining 100 with
certain amounts still to be paid. The
total amount of the pledges was
$67,584.50. The amount still due on
pledges is $82,444.80. In addition to that
there has been overpaid on pledges, that
is, more than the pledge called for,
$5,990.66. There has been turned in to
the committee, without any pledges at
all, merely as contributions, $7,638.10;
and up to the 20th of April this money,
as it has been paid in, has all been
turned in to the financial secretary.
"Now in addition to these amounts in
dollars and cents, there are in the cus-
tody of this committee, contributions as
follows: 5 shares of American Can, pre-
ferred, Worth about $450; 100 shares
Railroad stock, worth
about $4,400; 4 $50 Liberty Bonds worth
approximately $200; a beautiful piece of
tapestry, appraised at $1,200.
"The amount of money that has been
turned over to the financial secretary,
by the Building Fund Committee and
which is included in her report, is
$42,819.45."
Mr. Randall further stated that he
knew of certain substantial sums of
money which the donors planned to turn
into the temple treasury in the future.
Chairman D'Evelyn: "Mr. Hall will
now make his report."
