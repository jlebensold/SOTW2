THORNTON CHASE
FRIDAY, October 19th, 1917, was the
fifth anniversary of the visit of our
Beloved, the Center of the Covenant,
to the resting place of the
holy soul, Thornton Chase, who is
shining in the horizon of eternal life
ever like a star."
Twenty-one of the friends in Los An-
geles, including Mrs. Chase and a num-
ber of her personal friends, were priv-
ileged to gather in Inglewood at noon,
the hour Abdul-Baha visited the same
spot in 1912. The meeting was both a
dedication of the stone recently placed
there by Mr. C. Mason Remey and a
celebration of the visit of Abdul-Baha,
thus fulfilling his word to the friends to
"visit this grave and on my behalf bring
flowers, and seek the sublimity o-f the
spiritual station for him."
The thoughts of those present were
centered in the immortality of the soul,
the reading being extracts from the
words of Abdul-Baha on "Immortality"
and his remarks regarding Mr. Chase
uttered when in San Francisco. A prayer
revealed by Abdul-Baha for Thornton
Chase was read, as well as extracts from
his various writings. Mrs. Chase then
told us of incidents in the life of her
husband, how he come into the Move-
ment and something of what it meant
to be a Bahai in the early days of the
Cause in America. Frank B. Beckett.

MRS. SIDNEY ROBERTS
ON November'30th, 1917, Mrs. Sidney
E. Roberts, one of the active Bahai
workers in Denver, Colo., passed from
this World. She was one of Denver's
pioneers; always active in. good works
and faithful in visiting the sick and
poor. Her home was blessed by the
presence of Abdul-Baha when he was in
America, who told "her that she would
be remembered throughout coming ages.

Charles Ioas, of Chi-
cago, ascended to the
station given him by
Abdul-Baha in the fol-
lowing tablet to him .
from his holy presence,
in 1900: 
the honorable Mr. C. 
thou who hast advanced toward God!
By God, I rejoiced when reading thy
letter which declares thy belief in the
unity of God and thine acknowledg-
ment of the appearance of the Kingdom
of God. This is a matter whereby thy
face shall brighten in the Supreme Con-
course, and thy forehead shall sparkle
among the people. Then know the worth
of this gift, the lights of which shone
forth unto all directions and indicate
the attraction of the Concourse of El-
Abha, the Most Glorious. Then be firm
in this Cause, and thou wilt behold thy-
self in a lofty station, having all that
is in earth under its shadow, because[fit . 71:' I 5
