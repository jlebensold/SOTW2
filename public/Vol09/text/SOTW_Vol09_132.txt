(Reproduction of telegram to the STAR or THE WEST)
ALLAH 
Momentous changes are taking place in the Holy Land.
The doors of communication between Abdul-Baha and the outer World, are
opening. A few days ago the above telegram was received by the STAR or 
Wusr.
The full significance of these events cannot be grasped at this moment; only
the future will reveal them. It is likened unto the appearance of the sun after
long obscurity.
The dark clouds seem to be scattering.
A tumult of happiness and expectation reverberates in the hearts of the
Bahais. 'Ya-Baha-El-Aloha. I
