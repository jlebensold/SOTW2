The Branch
And there shall come forth a rod out of
the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow
out of his roots: and the Spirit of the Lord
shall rest upon him, the spirit of Wisdom
and understanding, the spirit of counsel and
might, the spirit of knowledge and of the
fear of the Lord; and shall make hiin of
quick understanding in the fear of the Lord;
and he shall not judge after the sight of his
eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of
his ears, but with righteousness shall he
judge the poor, and reprove With equity for
the meek of the earth; and he shall smite
the earth with the rod of his mouth, and
with the breath of his lips shall he slay the
Wicked. And righteousness shall he the
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the
girdle of his reins.
