Even the decorations typified the spirit
of the occasion. The tables radiated from
one center like rays from the sun, which
the focal point of the decorative scheme
represented, emblazoned with the Great-
est Name. .
Mr. Albert R. Windust gave the mes-
sage with power and clearness Dr. Zia
M. Bagdadi presented a burning and
poetic picture of the origin of the Feast
of El-Rizwan in the sacred garden of
Nadjib-Pasha, known as El-Rizwan, rose-
garden, where the Blessed Beauty (Ba-
ha'o'llah) unveiled his adored face and
lighted all the horizons of the world.
Miss Agnes Alexander told of the divine
seed sown in Japan, of the greatness of
her privilege in opening that land, and
because of her servitude and obedience
to Abdul-Baha, her lovely spirit was one
of the sweet pervading influences of all
the gatherings. She read many letters
filled with the passion and poetry of the
hearts of our Japanese brothers and sis-
ters aflame with the fire of the love of
FRIENDS, know that the believers of God' must be the cause of union and love
among all mankind, and until they attain to perfect harmony and agreement they
will not become the remedy for the healing oi this sick world. From the very
beginning of the Mashrak-cl-Azkar in Ishkabad, Russia, day by day, everylmag has
been in perfect harmony, until the believers there accomplished their aim, and it was
builded easily. for it was huilded by love. Now I hope that in America it will be the
same as in Russia, and the Mashrak-el-Azkar there he erected by the power of the 1
union and love existing among the believers.

the "new" Beloved, and couched in the
most touching language of the soul, of
devotion, gratitude, longing, humility
and aspiration.
At the first session of the Congress,
Sunday afternoon, April 28th, the divine
principles were not only expounded but
became clearly revealed through their
living expressions, the Bahais themselves.
The speakers, Mr. Alfred E. Lunt and
Mrs. May Maxwell, united in a oneness
of purpose, a harmony of ideas in which
each completed the voice of the other and
their thoughts were blended in an abso-
lute unity, thereby demonstrating that
ray of the Sun of Truth which proclaims
that man and woman are the two wings
