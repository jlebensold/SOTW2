"Great importance must be given to the development of the STAR or THE WEST. The
circle of its discussion must be widened; in its columns must be published the essential prob-
lems pertaining to the Bahai life in all its phases. Its contents must be so universal that
even the strangers may subscribe to it. Articles must be published, dealing with the uni-
versal principles of the Cause, the writers proving that this Cause takes a vital interest in
all the social and religious movements of the age and is conducive to the progress of the
world and its inhabitants. In short, the STAR or THE WEST must promote the aspirations and
the ideals that will gather little by little around these general Tablets, bringing into the light
of day all the historical, religious and racial knowledge which will be of the utmost value to
the Bahai teachers all over the World."

"Today the magnetic power that attracts heavenly blessings is teaching the
Cause of God. Whoever arises to perform this service the armies of the angels
will grant him victory. The three conditions of teaching the Cause of God are
the science of sociability, purity of deeds and sweetness of speech. I hope each
one of you may become confirmed with these three attributes.
"Therefore one must be wholly cleansed from desire and self and passion,
be abstracted (drawn apart) from the world of nature, become embodied light
and visualized spirit and then be engaged in teaching the Cause of God. Then
the fire of the love of God will flame so high as to attract the hearts of all man-
kind."
(Words of AB-DUL--BAHA in Tablet to friends in Denver, 1914. From
Diary of Mirza Ahmad Sohrab.)
