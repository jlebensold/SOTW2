Rouhi Eifendi, who began to cha11t a
long prayer, one of the Prayers of
Visitation. His chanting was the sweet-

passed quietly out. \Ve four Americans
were the last to leave, and as soon as we
had left the Tomb, Mrs. Hoagg came to
say that the Master was waiting to say
good-bye to us. He stood at the north-
east corner of the Tomb, and as we
passed he shook hands with each of us,
adding a caress for Sylvia. We turned
and watched him as he walked back to
the Tomb, waiting for the last glimpse!
Then we walked down the mountain in
the gathering dusk, and we were very
happy. On the way down Mirza Lot-
fullah told us interesting stories of the
spread of the Cause in Persia, of the
self-sacrifice and patience of the believ-
ers in trying to bring others to see the
Light of this day.
Of the Master 's talk on that first a.ft-
ernoon I can remember the following:
He said that we were very welcome, and
inquired Whether we were Well. Then
almost immediately he asked about. Mr.
Vail. Mrs. Paine said, "He sends his
love and longing. He wisl1es to do the

ABDUL-BAHA: "Mr. Vail is a good
man, a sincere man. He is very
illumined. 
C0-RA GRAY: "It is through his teach-
ing that we are here."
ABDUL--BAHA: "You must be very
grateful to him. He has been the cause
of your life. He has educated you. He
has no aim save to serve the Kingdom.
"Some people are ready for educa-
tion. They are like the fertile ground.
Some have not capacity, they are like
the barren or salty ground. His Holi-
ness Christ 11as told a story of the seed
that fell on stony ground and so it
could not grow. Other seeds fell in the
shallow earth, and they soon withered
away. But some fell on the good fertile
earth, and grew and produced fruit. So
it is with my words. Some fall on hearts
that have no capacity; they do not take
effect at all. Those people do not under-
