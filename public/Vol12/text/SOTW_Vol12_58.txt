58 STAR OF
Convey the utmost love, on my behalf,
to Mr. and Mrs. Weed and family.
Verily they have done their best, with
the ut.most sincerity, in the formation of
meetings. This service has been ac-
cepted in the Kingdom of Abha. . . .
His honor Mr. Remey, that luminous
person and heavenly man is occupied-
in service in Germany and Holland. He
does not rest for a moment and does not
breathe but to raise the call to the King-
dom of God.
Unto thee be the Glory of Abha!

O. O. 
O. O. Wolcott, Spokane, 
Upon him be the Glory of God, the
Most Glorious!
He Is God!
thou who art confirmed by the grace
of the Kingdom!
Thy long letter has been perused.
Thou hast given convincing answers to
the questions of the lawyer. The souls
who are free from every tie and are
baptized with the Holy Spirit, while
speaking, are inspired with divine in-
spirations. This is Why it is said that
(When) you are speaking you should
not think: you should speak What the
heart is inspired to.
The teachings are from His Most High,
The Father. The Son is the Expounder
of the teachings of the Fatlier. There-
fore, the teachings of both are one. As
to the line of poem which is mentioned
in the Seven Valleys, it is from His
Highness Ali, "Dost thou imagine that
thou art an insignificant molecule, While
in thee is enwrapped the Great Universe
(Macrocosm) i
He says, "Thou shouldst not look at
the smallness of thy body which is cast
out of the dust and is simply a handful
of earth; nay, rather shouldst thou look
at that pure spirit which is inclusive
THE WEST
of all the lofty attributes, and has some
affinity to this body." Because that
pure spirit is one of the graces of God
and is inclusive of all the virtues of
humanity. This pure spirit is like unto
the light Which is potential and i11 the
candle and gets enfiamed With the fire of
the love of God, then streams its light in
the stage of visibility.
The Jewish doctors have interpreted
the Bible according to their own selfish
desires, and not that they have discov-
ered the Truth.
But regarding the word Israel, this is
the title of Jacob himself and not that
of his children. Then from the word
of "Bani Israel" Bani (descendants)
was dropped and they sufficed with the
word "Israel." In there
are many such examples. The descen-
dants of Ham, for example, are called
"Ham," the descendants of Yates are
called "Yates. The descendants of the
Turks are named "Turks," and those of
Yaarub are called "Arab." Examples
such as these are many. Afterward the
word Israel Was used to denote the peo-
ple of God" as it is mentioned in the
Bible, i. the nations of God. Thus
it was gradually generalized as to denote
all the souls who accepted the religion of
God.
Upon thee be Baha-el-Abha!
