for solving all of these 
is /no remedy except faith and o>ssm~omce.
Faith is the ca--use of horm0w.y,- faith is
the cause of love; faith is the ca-use of
unity con-cord.
It is my hope that this race question
may be considered like unto the colors
of the doves and other birds. They do
not allow differeiices of color to be the
cause of hatred and animosity among
them. One flock of birds is White, an-
other gray, another yellow, another red,
another black. "They soar in the air
with each other with the utmost love
and do not fight with each other on ac-
count of their difference of color. Man
must, likewise, attain to this degree of
harmony, so that there may be no dif-
ferences or inharmony among the chil-
dren of 1ne11 on account of color, for all
of them are human beings.
Upon thee be Baha-cl-Abha!

(Words of Abdul-Baha--c0pied from
Lon-don Talks) 
Those who help on the cause of unity
are doing God's Work. Unity is the di-
vine bounty for this luminous century.
Enmity is 11ot so much the cause of
separation as it used to be; the cause
of disunion now is mostly prejudice.
These meetings teach us that unity is
good, and that suppression. (slavery
under the yoke of tradition and preju-
dice) is the cause of disunion. To imo-at
this is not enough. All knowledge is
good. but it can bear no fruit except by
a-otion. Vlfe hope the people realize and
know that tmity is good; and We also
hope that they Will not be content to
stand still in that knowledge. Do not
only so.-y that unity, love and brother-
hood are good; you must wor-ls for their
reaZri.ea.tion.
Compare the present time and the
feeling towards the colored people now,
with the state of feeling two or three
THE IVEST
hundred years ago, and see how much
better it is at present. In a short time
the relationship between the colored and
white people will still further improve,
and by and by no difference Will be felt
between them. White doves and purple
doves exist; but both kinds are doves.
once compared the col-
ored people to the black pupil of the 
surrounded by the White. In this black
pupil you see the reflection of that which
is before it, and through it the light of
the spirit shines forth.
In the sight of God color makes no
difference at all. He looks at the hearts
of men.
Fighting, and the employinent of
force, even for the right cause, will not
bring about good results. The op-
pressed, Who have right on their side,
must not take that right by force; the
evil would continue. Hearts must be
ch-(mged.
'No cannot believe the call to be spir-
itual When there is no result.
People get together and talk, but it
is God': ?Vord alone that is powerful in
its result.
First acquire knowledge, and when
conviction is reached. put it into
practice.
In conversation with a learned man
once, Abdul-Baha. said; . . . "You should
follow the teachings. Now you march;
read them."
(Copied from the Paris Talks of Abdul-
Baha): -
All peoples and nations are of one
family, the children of one Father, and
should be to one another as brothers
and sisters. I hope that you will en-
diea-oor in your lives to show forth mui
to sp-read this teaching.
