mediately," and therefore he did not
like to sleep outside any more, but
would come into the house. The fam-
ily were thankful, as they felt he would
be nearer to them if he needed any serv-
ice during the night. They now under-
stand the spiritual symbolism of the
"room" being the Beloved
One's body.
So you see, he did what he could to
make them ready that the blow might
not be too unexpected and sudden.
During all those days he was extraor-
dinarily loving and tender to every one
with whom he came in contact--they all
say, so much so, that they remarked
upon it.
The funeral took place on Tuesday
morning at 9 a. in. The whole of Acca
and Haifa attended. Mr. Kelsey has
taken some wonderful photographs o-f
the whole procession which he intends
to publish as soon as possible. The
High Commissioner, Sir H. Samuel,
came up from Jerusalem to be present
and he walked with the procession the
whole Way. Colonel Summers, the Gov-
ernor of Haifa, was also present. There
were Wonderful orations at the grave-
side. . . .
The lVlaster's body lies in the Tomb
of the Bab- (for the present) under-
neath the first chamber. Everything
in it is most bright and beautiful.
There are wonderful carpets spread
upon the floor and a ten-branched can-
dlestick on either side, besides all the
other lights. It Would cheer your hearts
to see it--it is all so bright and joyous.
I am sure we all feel that now is the
time for us all to be united with the
utmost love and firmness--to increase
our activities tenfold in teaching and
spreading the good news of the King-
dom.
My best love to you all and greetings
and love from all the family.
Yours ever in the blessed Cause,
Ethel Rosenberg.
My dear Mrs. George:
. . . . Tooba Khanum, I grieve, is ill
with the heart. She poured out all her
strength and energy in sustaining
others, Mrs. Krug said, and finally col-
lapsed from overstrain. She has been
in bed for some days and is now better,
I am told.
Khanum is wonderful; so are all the
ladies. I will try and enclose some-
thing for you to read to the assembled
friends.
. . . . Monaver Khanum sends her
love and says will you please pray for
them all. They all need your prayers
so much--in order that they may be
strengthened and guided to carry out
the beloved will and wishes in
every respect.
We have been to the Tomb each day
for prayers and chanting. On the sev-
enth day corn was distributed to all the
poor. On the ninth (the final ofiicial
day of mourning) we all went to Bahje
and the Holy Shrine, 138 pilgrims, but
the ladies of the household did not go.
I am going again with them, later.
Yours with love,
Ethel Rosenberg.

My dear uncle:
Oh! What a calamity has befa.llen us
by the departure of our beloved Master.
Several times in meetings during the
year, up to the time I left Haifa, he
said: have completed my work and
duties in this world and what is left
will be done by the friends. I want to
rest. The actions of the nakazeen and
others so injure me that if my heart
be pierced with a spear it will be much
easier to bear than these actions. Sup-
pressed sorrows will kill a man. If one
should relate his sorrows to a friend,
