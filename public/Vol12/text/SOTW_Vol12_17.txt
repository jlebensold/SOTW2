STAR OF THE WEST 17
Under the shining sky shall the lambs gaily bound:
Void of fear, undisturbed, safely shall they be feeding.
Then the timorous doves, Wheresoever they fly,
Shall not fear any more the haWk's merciless cry.
Lovely appear, over the mountains,
The feet of them that preach, and bring good news of peace."
From Bombay comes the news of the First All-India Bahai Convention--
another manifestation of the universal divine springtime.

Reduced tac-simile of parchment sent td the All-India Bahai Convention.
And it is fitting that the Bahais of Chicago should send Abha Greetings to
the First All-India Bahai Convention, inasmuch as the First All-American
Bahai Convention in 1909 was held in this city. Although sent by them, it is
in reality a greeting from all of the Bahais of America to the Bahais of India.
We reproduce it that all may share in its fragrance.
