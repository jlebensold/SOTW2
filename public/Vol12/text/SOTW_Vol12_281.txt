THE FUNERAL OF MIRZA ABUL HASSAN AFNAN
His Holiness ABDUL-BAHA one of the pall-bearers
if he attains to in this path.
Arise ye in service to the Cause of God
as the Apostles arose after the depar-
ture of Christ."
The Master has left a Will which is
His Covenant, written With his oWn
blessed hand. As soon as it is read, I
shall Write to you What it contains. It
is the hour of firmness and the moment
of steadfastness. Blessed are those who
are faithful to the Cause and loyal to
the Covenant.
Your brother,
Ahmad.
"The shock of his death was indeed as an earthquake"

"Very good." Little did they dream that We would see him no more at all at
the Pilgrim House. It was three days before the blessed departure that they
made the request, and thus We had no more the pleasure of seeing him come.
It was because of the stairway, which apparently was fatiguing to him to climb.
Also, he ate so little every time he came.
Tomorrow it will be one Week since We carried our blessed Lord's 
temple to Mount Carmel. John had the great privilege that day to assist in
carrying the coffin into the room in which our Lord lay, and John also assisted
in placing the holy body into the coffin. This is John 's everlasting bounty for
his services rendered to the Cause, and because of the privilege he had of lifting
the holy body of his Lord, John can never be the same being any more. And he is
and looks different, too. The holy mother said that We could never in this life
appreciate the privilege of having been here at just this time. She said that in
our presence here all the other American friends Were also present, and in
Johanna [Hauf, of Stuttgart] all the German friends Were present.
