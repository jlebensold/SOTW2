ting at the far end of the room, his back
to the window, into which the sun
poured. The strongest image in my
memory is this luminous one of Abdul-
Baha sitting by the window, the ma-
jestic head dominating the holy figure,
teaching us with smiles and gestures
divine.
The meeting over, a few of us went
upstairs. Abdul-Baha looked in, calling
Juliet!" whereupon I joyously ran
out to him.
"Bring your things in here and paint
now," he said, pointing to the front
room, the library.
Oh, these sittings, so wonderful, yet
so difficult! We move from room to
room, from background to background,
light to light. He has given me three
half hours, each time in a difierent
room. who could
paint him"! . . .
The next morning, Thursday, I went
up very early to the house, but did not
see the Masterwonderful talk with Valiolah Khan.
"My father," said Valiolah Khan,
"was much with One
night as he strode back
and forth in his room, said to my father:
'At stated periods souls are sent to
earth by the Mighty God with what we
call the power of the great ether. And
those who possess this power can do
anything; they have all power. Even
this walk of mine,' said 
'has an effect in the world. Jesus Christ
had this power. The people thought
him a poor young man whom they had
crucified; but he possessed the power of
the great ether, therefore he could not
remain underground. This ethereal
power rose and quickened the world.
And now look to the Master,' said
'for this power is his!'
added Valiolah
Khan, "taught my father much about
Agha. Agha (Master) you know is one
of the titles of Abdul-Baha, and the
Greatest Mystery of God is another, and
the Greatest Branch is another. By all
these we call him in Persia. The
Blessed Perfection, re~
vealed the station of Abdul-Baha to my
father. And my father wrote many
poems to the Master, though the Mas-
ter would scold him and say, 'You must
not Write such things to me!' But the
heart of my father could not keep quiet.
Once he wrote:
Dawning-Place of the Beauty of
God! I know Thee!
Though Thou wrappest Thyself in ten
thousand veils--I know Thee!
Though Thou shouldst wear the tatters
of a beggar--still would I know
Thee!' 
In the afternoon I returned with my
mother. Abdul-Baha received us in his
room, full of lilies and carnations and
roses.
Mrs. Thompson! Marhaba!
Marhaba I 'Welcome. 
The intonation of that "Mar-haba!"
welcome from a heart deeper than
any human heart; a welcome indeed!
Only this generation may know it on
earth, but it is before all the world in
the future at the threshold of Heaven!
The next morning I saw Abdul-Baha
alone and we spoke of a friend, who had
failed to understand Abdul-Baha's
meaning the other day, thinking he
meant to teach asceticism, that the spirit
and the flesh were two separate things.
"That is not what I said," replied
Abdul-Baha. said that the spiritual
man and the materialist were two differ-
ent beings. The spirit is in the flesh,"
he added.
"Yes, I know," I answered, beaming
at the beauty of this and its deep sig-
nificance, for there it all was--every-
thing was said in those six words.
Those precious sittings, so few, with
dear May and Lua praying beside me
while I worked, perceiving and encour-
aging while I painted with a breathless
and blind speed, lifted up on a Wave of
inspiration, only feeling!
