Tablets from Abdul-Baha to Bahais in America
CHARLES M. HANSON
To his honor, Mr. Charles M. Hanson,
Duluth, him be the
Glory of God the Most Glorious!
Is God!
thou who art firm in the Covenant.
The glad-tidings of the unity of the
friends caused much happiness. tid-
ings will give so much exhilaration as
that of the union of the friends. For
unless the union of the Bahais is estab-
lished how can they become the cause of
the oneness of humanity'? First, the
Bahais should be united with one another
in the utmost love and oneness, and then
they will be able to raise the banner of
the oneness of mankind.
Therefore, I was much delighted with
thy news. My hope is that thou mayest
travel to the cities of those regions, and
spread the Teachings of His Holiness
BAHA 
Upon thee be BAHA

ton, D. C.--Unto her be the Glory of
God, the Most Glorious !--Care of the
favored maid-servant of God, Mrs. H.
Emogene Hoagg--~U11to her be BAHA

He Is God!
thou who art firm in the Covenant!
Thy letter has been received. Praise
be unto God, it indicates that through
the presence of enabe Fazel a new book
has been opened. It is my hope that
the friends may receive at every moment
a new spirit and so arise to act as they
should have to.
I was very glad to learn that after the
death of Mr. Parmerton thou hast moved
forth according to the call of the Teach-
ing Committee; that thou hast severed
thyself from the world and those
who live thereupon; that thou hast
turned thine attention to the Kingdom
of Abha that thou hast made the whole
of the globe of earth thy home, and thou
hast been spreading the breaths (teach-
ings).
Offer thanks unto God that thou hast
been thus confirmed; that consequently
thou hast become favored by Abdul-
Baha; that thou art supplicating assist-
ance and confirmation for the friends of
God, and thou lovest all of them! Be
thou assured that thou wilt be confirmed.
I supplicate God's blessing upon thy
revered sister and all thy family.
Unto thee be the Glory of Abhal
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
