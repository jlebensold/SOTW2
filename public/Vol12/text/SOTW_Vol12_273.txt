WORDS OF ABDUL-BAHA
"Great importance must be given to the development of the STAR OF THE WEST. The
-ircle of its discussion must be widened; in its columns must be published the essential prob-
ems pertaining to the Bahai life in all its phases. Its contents must be so universal that
ven the strangers may subscribe to it. Articles must be published, dealing with the uni-
ersal principles of the Cause, the writers proving that this Cause takes a vital interest in
ll the social and religious movements of the age and is conducive to the progress of the
rorld and its inhabitants. In short, sthe STAR OF THE WEST must promote the aspirations and
1e ideals that will gather little by little around these general Tablets, bringing into the light
day all the historical, religious and racial knowledge which will be of the utmost value to
1e Bahai teachers all over the world." F,-om Unveiling of the Divine
