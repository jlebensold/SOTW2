Mr. Albert R. Vail delivered a most
appealing address on "The Radiant
Century of the Passing of Prejudice."
"Nobody knows," he said, "the trouble
prejudice has brought to the World ex-
cept the loving heart of God, who is
today leading His children to unity and
obedience." He told interesting stories
to prove the absurdity of prejudice,
which he compared to a thick veil, cov-
ering the eyes. His persuasive argu-

men .are brothers. At most, some are
strong, and they should help the Weak;
some have vision, and they ought to open
the eyes of the blind; some have loving
hearts, and they ought, through kind-
ness, to inspire others to be kind.
Hon. Theodore Burton of Ohio re-
ferred to his speaking from the same
platform, sixteen years ago, with Theo-
dore Roosevelt, then president of the
United States. He related how that

Great Day of God
Great Day of God, long looked
for,
Thy dawn we do proclairn.
Great day when ev'ry nation
Shall praise His Holy Name.
Great Day of resurrection,
Of unity and love,
Soon bright in all its splendor
Thy Sun shall shine above.
Great day of Might and Power,
Of Knowledge and of Light,
No clouds of superstition
Can now bedim our sight.
Great Day, when God, the
Father,
Is knowii o'er ail the earth,
And to His whole creation
Hath given a new birth.
Great Day of' the unveiling
Of Truth's deep mysteries,
When every hidden secret
Of earth and sky and seas,
In all their wondrous beauty,
To man shall be revealed;
Nor can an act or motive
By man now be concealed.
Great Day of God, All glorious;
Great Day of Peace, so blest;
The thought of Thee brings
gladness,
And dilates every breast.
Great Day of one religion,
When all are understood;
One faith in Life Etemal,
One God, one Brotherhood.

great executive had said that it Was
wrong to close the door of hope and
opportunity upon any race. He de-
plored the increase of prejudices stirred
up among all races by the War, making
a beautiful plea for tolerance and free-
dom. Those Who persevere to the end
will surely succeed. He denounced mob
violence and expressed the hope that
effective laws against it might be en-
acted.
