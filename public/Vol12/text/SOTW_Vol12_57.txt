His honor Fazel is verily of the ut-
most sincerity, without any desire save
service to the Cause of God. Miss

Do thou always keep up thy corre-

Japan and Australia. I am praying to
God to enable some active teachers to
arise and give light unto the horizons
of America. The erection of the monu-
ment to the memory of his honor Agha
Mirza Abul F'azl is very appropriate
and advisable.
