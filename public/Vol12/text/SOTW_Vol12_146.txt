and the twenty-third psalm every night
before I go to bed. I pray, too."
"To pray is not to read psalms. To
pray is to trust in God and to be sub-
missive in all things to Him. Be sub-
missive, then things Will change for you.
Put your family in God 's hands. Love
God's will. Strong ships are not con-
quered by the sea; they ride the waves!
Now be a strong ship, not a battered
one."
At noon I took Mr. to him.
As we sat alone in the library, waiting
for Abdul-Baha to return from the gar-
den, I said: 
think what he said at Mr. Gifford
Pinchot's last week was very interest-
ing, that the people were rising like a
great tide, Wave upon wave, and unless
the capitalists realized soon, they would
be driven out with violence; that the
people in the future would not work for
wages, but for an interest in the con-
eerns."
Just then Lua appeared at the door
of the room where she had been sitting,
bending toward the stairway with beau-
tiful reverence.
is coming?" I asked.
"Yes, he is coming, Juliet."
He came into the room with both
hands extended, and in a voice like a
chime from his heart he said:
"Oh-h, Mr. Mr. 
Such love, such gladness, such sweet-
ness, such welcome!
Then I slipped out.
When I re-entered the room Abdul-
Baha was signing a photograph for
Mr. rather, writing a prayer
on it.
"And now," Abdul-Baha said as he
presented it, "you must give me your
photograph. I want your face. I have
given you mine, now you must give me
yours."
will pray for you," he added, as
he said farewell to Mr. will
mention you daily in my prayers."
Abdul-Baha detained me a moment.
As I rejoined Mr. Valiolah Khan
THE WEST
was entering the house. We (Mr.
and I) were both out in an auto-
mobile.
"Do you see that young man going-
into the house?" I asked. "That is
Valiolah Khan. His father was cut into
pieces alive while his own little son
(Valiolah Khan 's youngest brother) was
forced to look on at the butchery."
'If you will deny 
the executioners said to the child, 'we
will take you to the palace of the Shah
and honors and wealth will be heaped
upon you.'
'But I do not want these things,'
the little fellow answered.
'Then, if you do not deny him,' they
continued, 'we will kill you worse than
your father.' (I am expressing this
just as Valiolah Khan did, in his Eng-
lish.)
'You may kill me a thousand times
worse,' was the reply. 'Is my blood of
more value than my father's?2 To die in
the path of is my supreme
desire.' Then they fell on the child and
choked him.
day or two ago," I continued,
Valiolah Khan asked me about the
portrait of Abdul-Baha--hoW it was get-
ting on. 'One should paint the soul in
a portrait, I think,' he said.
'But who can paint the soul of
Abdul-Baha?' I asked.
'We can paint it with our blood.'
he replied, very gently, but with kind-
ling eyes."
The next day, Wednesday, June 13, as
usual I went very early to Abdul-Baha's,
so early that no one was there, that is,
110 callers. Some of the Persians, of
course, were with Khan
and Mirza Ali Akbar. I found them
