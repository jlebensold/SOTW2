STAR OF THE 157
"There was another martyr," contin-

the Blessed Beauty that he could not
help but follow him to Teheran, though
had told him to remain
with his aged parents, who had also be-

"Still he followed! And when he
reached Te-heran, it was just at the time
that a great persecution had fallen upon
the Bahais because of the attempt on
the life of Nassir Ed Din Shah by two
fanatical believers; and 
had been cast i11to a dungeon; and it
was in the dungeon that Mirza 
Shirazi found the Blessed Perfection
again, when, asking for 
he was led to the dungeon to be chained,
with other disciples, to his Master! So
he found him again! The disciples
were all bound by the same chain to
Set into the chain were
iron collars which were fastened by iron
pins around the neck, and each day a
believer was unchained and killed, until
alone was left; a11d none

first. intimation they received that their
time had come was when the jailer took
out the pin from the collar. This was
the sign.
"And one day the pin was taken out
from Mirza Shirazi's collar.
Then Mirza Shirazi stepped joy-
fully forward. First he kissed the feet
of the Blessed Beauty and

of the mart-yr had entered into him, or

was enacting the tragedy to come, when
Abdul-Baha himself, the Center of the
Covenant of God, would go forth in
ecstacy to his own 
When that day comes, that day of
tears for heaven and shame for earth,
I shall see Abdul-Baha as he Was at

song--eostatic and tragic beyond any-
thing I had ever heard.
This was What the Cause meant, then!
This Was what it meant to "live near

the realm of divine tragedy.
"And thus," ended Abdul-Baha,

vision real to us. A smile of exultation
played on his lips. Very low, so that it
sounded like an echo, he hummed the
