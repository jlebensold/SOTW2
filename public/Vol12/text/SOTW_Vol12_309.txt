DR. SARAH CLOCK
TEI-IERAN, PERSIA, January 24, 1922.
DR. DIED, IPNEUMONIA. NOTIFY ramnns. (Signed) MOODY.
On the 8tl1 of September, 1910, Dr. Clock sailed from New York for Persia.
Twelve years of self-sacrificing service is her contribution to the Bahai Cause in
Teheran. We believe a letter is on the Way telling in detail of her life and
passing. Upon her be the mercy of God !--The Editors.

Telegrams from her daughter:
"Mother passed peacefully into the Kingdom of Light the morning of
February nineteenth." Ella G. Cooper.
"Impossible to finish article for this issue STAR. Any account of her life
must contain the history of the Cause in California which takes time to pre-
pare." Ella G. Cooper.
With the passing of this great soul, the Cause has lost one of its splendid
pillars in America, and the STAR or THE \VEs'r one of its staunchest friends and
supporters. We look forward to publishing the article referred to in the tele-
gram in a near issue of the STAR or THE WEST. On behalf of all the friends,
we extend to the bereaved family our hea.rtfelt Editors.
