STAR OF THE WEST
The Day of God
PRAISE be to Thee, C) God of Names
and Creator of Heaven! Praise be to
Thee, for Thou hast made known un~
to Thy servants Thy Day wherein the
River of Life streamed forth from the
finger of Thy Generosity and the Foun~
tain of Revelation and Unity became
manifest, by Thy Manifestation, to all
who are in Thy earth and Heaven.
God! This is a Day the Light of
which Thou hast sanctified above the sun
and its eftulgence. I testify that this Day
is illumined by the Light of Thy ace
and by the effulgence of the dawning
Lights of Thy Manifestation.
Thou, my God, and the Beloved of
my heart! With the name of this Day
