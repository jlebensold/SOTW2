The City of Acca
the change of seasons, so the color of
man's thoughts mark the progress of
his soul. The divine palette with its
variegated hues is ever found in the city
of the star, and the star always shines
over the Holy Land, the home of the
prophets. The soul of the pilgrim is
the canvas prepared for the handiwork
of the Creator.
It is difficult to describe the effect
produced by the matchless blending of
colors in the masterpiece of the artist;
it is even more difficult to portray the
emotions and sensations of the heart of
the pilgrim when he visits the sacred
abode of the Manifestation of God. As
the pilgrim enters Acca he feels his soul
transcending the ties to the
realm of spiritual susceptibilities. The
framework of the picture, such as the
life and customs of centuries gone by,
vanishes and the design itself commences
to unfold.

closes the horse stalls where the little
band of exiles were crowded together.
Then the small room, now in ruins,
where was cast that first
night of his arrival, is seen. The detail
of the picture becomes clearer as he
mounts a steep and narrow stairway to
the room of stone flags Without bed and
chair, where was confined
for two years. What lofty thoughts
must have surged here! Glancing across
the inner court, a barred window is no-
Baha'o'llah's prison room where he was
confined for two years
ticed. Here was wont to
stand that the foot-sore and weary pil-
grims from distant Persia might catch
a fleeting glimpse of him from the plain
of Acca, now called "the worshipping
place of God". The masterpiece has
expanded but the work is not yet fin-
ished.
The pilgrim leaves the city and trav-
els over the desert plain to the Rizwan
Garden. Here spent the
latter years of his life perfecting the
design of the Creator. Again the wan-

for "the desert has rejoiced and blos-

in foliage and myriad blossoms, breathes
