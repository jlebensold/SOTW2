Letter from Secretary of the All-India Bahai Convention
Bombay, India, February 16th, 1921.
The Spiritual Assembly, Chicago.
Dear Bahai brothers in the' Holy Cause:
Permit me on behalf of the First All-India Bahai Convention held in
Bombay 27-29th December, 1920, to offer you our cordial thanks for the message
of love and affection sent to us along with the beautiful picture of the Mashreq 'ul-
Azkar of Chicago. The letter was read before the Convention on the 29th of
December and the picture was passed around. A collection was then raised for
the Chicago Temple and the amount will be remitted by means of draft. Allow
me to thank you once more on behalf of the delegates and the Bahais of India.
With sincere Bahai greetings,
Yours in His Name,
Pritam Singh, Secretary English Section.
