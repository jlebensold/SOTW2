olarer of principles must inevitably have
those who agree and praise and those
who disagree and reject."
Mohammed Efiendi Safadi (a highly
educated Mohammedan poet) composed
and read a poem:
"On Sunday night heaven was opened
and the spirit of Abdul-Baha flew
with its glory.
It was received and entertained by the
prophets.
He was Washed by the Water of Para-
dise.
All the people reverently walked for
him, even the Kings and their Gov-
ernors.

Mount Carmel, thou art now more
proud than the heaven, for thou hast
become the holiest mountain.
Abdul-Baha, thou art now missed by
those thou didst care for; thou didst
cure their ailments and thou wert their
remedy.
I shall weep with tears for thee as long
'as I am living; how often thou didst
wipe them with thy hands;
It is befitting that the creatures should
weep for thee, because in thy depar-
ture they have lost their moon and
intelligence.
God is great: Adam, Moses, Christ and
Mohammed have sung praises to thy
soul, yearning for its meeting.
If I could, I would have composed a
poem of the jewels of the stars for
the praise of the people of Abdul-
Baha."
