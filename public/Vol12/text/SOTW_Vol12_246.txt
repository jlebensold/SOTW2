24-6 STAR OF THE WEST
And in the heavenly World'!
for the pen of a Milton, the brush of a Dore and the music of a Handel,
to convey a fleeting glimpse of What is transpiring!
If it were according to Divine Wisdom that such a scene be pictured,
only the vision and Wo1*d of Him who has ascended could describe it!
But His utterance is stilled--
And our pen is broken.
In this hour We find ourselves chanting the Tablet of Visitatioii.

Tablet of Visitation
REVEALED BY HIS HOLINESS BAHA TO HIS HOLINESS
TI-IE BAB.
Chantecl in the Holy Tomb of His Holiness BAHA emol the Holy Tomb
of His Holiness the BAB by all Pilgrims, a/mt now chanted by the Baha/is
of the world in praise of His Holiness ABDUL-BAHA who hath ascended
to the King-dom of ABHA:
THE praise that appeared from Thy Supreme Self and the glory that
dawned from Thy most glorious beauty, be unto Thee, Thou the Mani-
festation of Grandeur, the King of Eternity and the Ruler of Wholnso-ever is in
earth and heaven!
I testify that by Thee Was revealed the Sovereignty of God a.nd His Power,
the greatness of God and His grandeur; and by Thee arose the ancient suns
in the heaven of destiny; and dawned the Invisible Beauty from the horizon
of creation; and by a motion of Thy pen the command of IT 
hath appeared, the Hidden Mystery of God was unfolded; the contingent
beings We-re created and the Manifestations (of God) were sent forth.
And I testify by Thy beauty the beauty of the Adored One was mani-
fest and by Thy face, the face of the De-sired One was revealed; and by a
Word from Thee there Was a separation among the contingent beings,- the
sincere ascended to the highest summit and the polytheists descended to the
lowest degrees.
