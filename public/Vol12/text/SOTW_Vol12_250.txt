am with you always"
Words of ABDUL-BAHA.
I say unto you that anyone who will rise up in the Cause of God at this
time shall be filled with the Spirit of God, and that He Will send His hosts from
heaven to help you and that nothing shall be impossible to you if you have
faith. And now I give you a commandment which shall be for a covenant
between you and me--that{ ye have faith; that your faith be steadfast as a rock
that no storms can move, that nothing can disturb, and that it endure through
all things even to the end; even should ye hear that your Lord has been crucified,
be not shaken in your faith; for I am with you always, whether living or dead,
I am with you to the end. As ye have faith so shall your powers and blessings
be. This is the standard--this is the standard--this is the standard.
