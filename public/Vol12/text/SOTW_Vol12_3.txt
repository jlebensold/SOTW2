"We desire but the good of the world and the
happiness of the nations; that all nations shall
become one in faith and all men as brothers;
that the bonds of affection and unity between
the sons of men shall be strengthened, that
diversity of religion shall cease and differences
of race be annulled. So it shall be; these fruit
less strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away,
and the 'Most Great Peace' shall come."
