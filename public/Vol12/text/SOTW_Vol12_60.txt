60 STAR OF
opened and thou hast acquired the power
of spiritual healing. Thou hast sought
and found the Truth and hast been
aware of heavenly mysteries.
The teachings of His Holiness 
like unto the rays of the sun
illumine the East as well as the West,
vivify the dead and unite the various
religions. They prove the oneness of
God, for they gather all communities of
the world under the pavilion of the
oneness of the world of mankind.
Consider how stirred the world is and
in what a commotion are the people of
the world. Heavenly power is needed
to do away with this stir and agitation.
Otherwise this great cause will not be
realized through human power. Human
power, no matter how strong it may be,
illumines like unto an ignited lamp
a limited space and trains a small num-
ber of souls. It is the sun which illum-
ines all regions, and it is the heav-
enly power which gathers around a si11-
gle spot all the sects and communities.
Strive therefore that thou mayest serve
this remarkable power and attain unto
profitable and far reaching results.
Upon ye be Baha-el-Abha!

AGNES ALEXANDER
To the daughter of the Kingdom, Miss
Agnes Alexander, Tokyo, 
Upon her be the Glory of God, the
Most Glorious!
He Is God!
thou who art the daughter of the
Kingdom!
Thy letter has been received. Praise
be unto God, that in those regions the
breezes of the rose-garden of Abha are
spreading. It is my hope that those
regions may become perfumed, the
breezes of favor waft, the lights of
THE WEST
guidance radiate and the graces of the
Merciful be unveiled.
Convey on my behalf respectful greet-
ings to Mrs. Finch. I hope that you two
shall, in utmost affection and union,
start in the service of the Kingdom, be-
come the cause of the illumination of
that dark country and that the breezes
of the heavenly rose-garden may be
spread.
Convey my deepest love and affection
to Mr. Torii and Mr. Inouye and Mr. Sai-
ki, and also to all other friends. Through
the graces of the bounty of Aloha I
cherish the hope that these souls may
become sublime emblems and fruitful
trees in this Supreme Paradise, because
a productive man is like unto a tree
which is fruitful and of large shadow,
and so he is the ornament of the garden
of Paradise.
This world, though apparently orna-
mented, yet its ornamentation is like
unto the freshness of the flowers on the
meadow whose prosperity lasts but for a
short time, fading speedily through the
heat of the sun and the blowing of the
wind. The heavenly trees, however,
are always green, fresh, full of blossoms
and continually yielding fruits. They
remain till eternity in perfect fineness,
freshness and vigor.
Extend my great kindness and praise
to the maid-servant of God, Fuye Muchi-
zuki, so that she may with a divine pow-
er, a heavenly purpose and Godly mo-
tive, start her writing and that the
breaths of the Holy Spirit may help
her pen.
I am supplicating to God to help Mr.
Fukuta progress day by day, to guide
the Japanese women to tear up the cur-
tains of superstitions, observe the lights
of Truth, seek eternal life and lo11g for
everlasting bestowal.
Upon thee be Baha-el-Abha!
