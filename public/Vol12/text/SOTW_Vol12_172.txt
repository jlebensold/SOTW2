172 STAR OF
though I sensed that he Wished to, but
I did not feel at liberty to speak. Ab-dul-
Baha, himself, was there to speak.
We went through the Museum, Abdul-
Baha being quite amused with the big
Whale, saying: "He could hold seventy
onahs."
In the Mexican exhibit, which inter-
ested him very much, he remarked on
the close resemblance of the sculpture
to what had been found in Egypt.
"Only, this is better," he said.
"There is a tradition," I ventured,
"of a connection between this country
and Asia in the far past?"
"Assuredly," he answered, "before a
great catastrophe there was connection
between Asia and America."
Though Abdul-Baha had already rest-
ed in the Museum, he sat down again
outside, on a soft little curve of ground
beneath a young tree. He sat some little
time there, we standing behind him on
the flags of the Walk. Was he waiting
for some one'?
Bye and bye the old watchman stole
up to us.
"Is he tired?" he whispered softly to
me. "Who is he; he looks like a great
man."
Divining that the Jew was a socialist,
I replied that Abdul-Baha was a great
sufferer for the cause of brotherhood.
Then I told him something of the story
of Abdul-Baha's sufferings.
should like to speak to him," said
the watchman, so I led him to Abdul-
Baha.
Abdul-Baha looked up, his brilliant
eyes full of sweetness.
"Come and sit by me," he said.
"No, I must not," answered the
Watchman.
"Is it against the rules for me to sit
on the grass?" asked Abdul-Baha.
may sit there all day!"
"You didn't see the whole of the Mu-
seum," continued the old Watchman.
"Would you like to go back after you
have rested? There are the fossils and
the birds."
THE WEST
said Abdul-Baha, smiling. 
am tired of going about looking at the
things of this world. I want to go above
--and travel and see in the spiritual
worlds. What do you think about that 
he asked suddenly, with another lumi-
nous smile.
The old watchman looked puzzled
and scratched his head.
"Which would you rather possess?"
pursued Abdul-Baha, "the material or
the spiritual World?"
"Well, I guess the material," the
watchman answered seriously. "You
know you have that, anyway!"
"But you do not lose it when you
attain the spiritual. When you go up-
stairs in a house, you do not leave the
house. The lower floor is under you."
"Oh, yes!" All of a sudden the light
broke from the old man 's face.
Then Abdul-Baha rose and, standing
beneath that young tree, the sun shin-
ing on his robes, taught the old Jew,
with his irrefutable logic, yet with ir-
resistible smiles and charm, of the spirit-
ual agreement of Christ and Moses. Oh,
if only I could make you see that pic-
ture, call it into life again for you 
the old Jew and his unrecognized Mes-
siah, this one of whom he had asked,
"Is he a Jew?" who so strangely mag-
netized him and inspired him with ten-
derness and awe--the touched, question-
ing face of the Jew, and, the Radiant
Stranger, like the vision of some long-
past prophet, the "Ancient of Days"
and "the Divine Youth" in one, by some
strange alchemy of spirit. Surely, the
Jew must have felt something. Chris-
tians had said of this visitor from the
East: "That Figure makes me think
of the plains of Judea;" seemed to
be talking with Moses, or Isaiah."
Race-instinct, deep race-hopes, must
have stirred within the Jew.
(I returned a number of times to the
Museum to try to find the old watchman,
but I never saw his face again. He
mu-st have been called very soon "up-
stairs in the house.")
