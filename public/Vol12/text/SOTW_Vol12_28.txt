MR. AND MRS. LATIMER
A prayer for Mr. James and Rouhani
Latimer, care of his honor, Mr. George
Latimer--Upon them be 
El-Abha!
He Is God!
ye two souls of the Kingdom!
Turn your faces to the Kingdom of
the merciful One and address this
prayer:
Pra-yer.
thou Compassionate God! We Were
heedless, Thou hast made us heedful.
We were slumbering and Thou hast
awakened us. We were thoughtless,
Thou hast made us thoughtful. We had
no share and portion from the supreme
bounty, Thou hast given us full share
therefrom; We were Wanderers, Thou
hast shown us the right path. We were
thirsty, Thou hast 'quenched our thirst.
We were deprived, Thou hast made us
intimates with Thy mysteries.
Praise be unto Thee, that such a
bounty has been realized and such a
guidance has been made possible. Con-
firm us in firmness and steadfastness
that We may be self-sacrificing in service
to the Kingdom and may attain our
loftiest aim.

SANTA PAULA ASSEMBLY
To the members of the Spiritual Assem-
bly, Santa Paula, 
them be El-Abha!
He Is God!
ye who are firm in the Covenant!
Abdul-Baha is constantly engaged in
ideal communication With any spiritual
Assembly which is instituted through
the divine bounty, and the members of
which, in the utmost devotion, turn
to the divine Kingdom and are firm in
the Covenant. To them he is heartily
attached and with them he is linked by
everlasting ties. Thus correspondence
with that gathering is sincere, constant
and uninterrupted.
At every instant, I beg for ye assist-
ancc, bounty, and a fresh favor and
blessing; so that the confirmations of
His Holiness may, like
unto the sea, be constantly surging, the
lights of the Sun of Truth may shine
upon you all and that ye may be con-
firmed in service, may become the mani-
festation of bounty and that each one of
ye may, at dawn, turn unto the Holy
Land and may experience spiritual emo-
tions With all intensity.
Upon ye be Baha-el-Abha!
(Signed) ABDUL--BAHIA ABBAS.
