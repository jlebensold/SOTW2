STAR OF THE WEST
Thou hast adorned Thy Tablet, which is
known only to Thee. Thou hast called it
"The Day of God." Nothing is to be seen
therein but Thy Supreme Self, and
naught is to be remembered save Thy
sweetest Name. Wherefore, when He
appeared, the foundation of nations
trembled, the learned were bewildered
and the wise men were confounded, save
those who came near unto Thee. took
from the hand of Favor the pure wine of
Thy inspiration, and drank in Thy Name,
saying: "Praise be unto Thee, Desire
of the nations! Praise be to Thee, Be~
loved of the hearts of the yearning!"
