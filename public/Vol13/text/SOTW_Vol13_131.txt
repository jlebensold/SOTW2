THE NEED OF A UNIVERSAL PROGRAM
NIVERSALITY is of God,"
Writes Abdul Baha, and all lim-
itations are 
"We know in part and We prophesy
in part; but when that which is perfect
is come that which is in part shall be
done away."
All our human thinking and social
programs, our prescriptions for the
world's illnesses have been partial, frag-
mentary. Peace conferences find no ef-
fective solution. Prejudice, strikes,
preparations for War continue to grow
and spread. I-low can civilizatio-n be
saved?
A universal society of nations with a
universal limitation of armaments is a
remedy. A universal language is an-
other. But the illness of the World is too
serious to be cured by any one remedy.
"The world of humanity," says Abdul
Baha, "will not be transformed into the
heavenly paradise through the promotion
of one, single principle. Every prog-
ressive principle which is the cause of
the advancement of the World of human-
ity is like a simple element. A simple
element does not produce a composite
life. But when the elements are asso-
ciated together then a being is brought
into existence.
"The Cause of Baha'U]lah and his
heavenly teachings include all the ele-
ments and principles of perfection.
Among these (principles) are: the high-
est efficiency in the educational system,
the oneness of the world of humanity,
the conformity of religion with science
and reason, equality of rights among the
children of men, the breaths of the Holy
Spirit, equality of men and women, the
sweeping away of the prejudices existing
among the various religions, heavenly
morals, the fragrances of the Merciful,
universal peace, etc. The Cause of
Baha'Ul1ah combines in it all these prin-
ciples.
