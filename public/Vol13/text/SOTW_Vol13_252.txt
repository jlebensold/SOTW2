being. God, I will not Worry any
more. I will not let trouble harass me
any longer. I will not dwell on the
unpleasant things of life. God! Thou
art kinder to me than myself. I dedi-
cate myself to Thee, Lord!"
These prayers of the Bab are aglow
with spiritual dynamic:
"Is there any remover of difficulties
but God? Say! Praise be to God! He is
God! All are His servants and all are
standing by His command."

"In the name of God, the Victor of
the Most Victorious, proclaim: God will
help all those who arise to serve Him.
No one is able to deprive Him of His
majesty, His Dominion, His sovereignty
for in the heaven and the earth and in
all the realms of God He is the Victor-
ious and the Conqueror."
"Say! God sufficeth all things above
all things and nothing in the heavens
or in the earth but God sufficeth. Verily,
He is in Himself the Knower, the Sus-
tainer, the Omnipotent."
PHYSICAL HEALING
Some rules for health, from a Tablet
revealed by Baha'Ullah.
God! The Supreme Knowerl The
Ancient Tongue speaks that which will
satisfy the wise in the absence of doc-
tors.
People, do not eat except when you
are hungry. Do not drink after you
have retired to sleep.
Exercise is good when the stomach is
empty; it strengthens the muscles.
When the stomach is full it is very
harmful.
Do not neglect medical treatment,
when it is necessary, but leave it off
when the body is in good condition.
Do not take nourishment except when
(the process of) digestion is completed.
Do not swallow until you have thor-
oughly masticated your food.
Treat disease first of all through diet,
and refrain from medicine. If you can
find What you need for healing in a sin-
gle herb do not use a compound medi-
cine. Leave off medicine when the health
1s good, and use it in case of necessity.
If two diametrically opposite foods
are put on the table do not mix them.
Be content with one of them. Take first
the liquid food before partaking of solid
food. The taking of food before that
which you have already eaten is digested
is dangerous. . . .
When you have eaten walk a little
that the food may settle.
That which is difficult to masticate is
forbidden by the wise. Thus the Su-
preme Pen commands you.
A light meal in the morning is as a
light to the body.
Avoid all harmful habits: they cause
unhappiness in the world.
Search for the causes of disease. This
saying is the conclusion of this utter-
ance.
BAHAI PROPHECIES
With the fall of the Sultan of Turkey
We realize anew the prophetic power of
Baha'Ullah, and we read again the Tab-
lets which he wrote to the kings inviting
them to establish "international peace
and the oneness of the human world."
God has willed that in this age univer-
sal peace must reign, and nothing can
withstand the will of God.
Fifty years ago Baha'Ullah prophe-
sied the World War, the fall of the
kings and the social upheavals which
would shake. the World. "The events
that have transpired," Wrote Abdul
Baha in 1919, "Were all recorded fifty
years ago in the epistles of Baha/Ullah,
epistles which have been printed, pub-
lished and spread all over the world."
In California, in 1912 Abdul Baha an-
nounced thatthe
battle of Armageddon referred to in the
