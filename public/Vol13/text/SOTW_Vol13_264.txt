THE TEMPLE BEAUTIFUL
By Albert Durrant Watson
Love Immortal, beautiful and olden,
Qur eyes thy walls of splendour soon shall see,
For We will build a temple grand and golden
-With silent hammers of eternity.
Come let us build a city, my brothers,
The loveliest and holiest dream of time,
The joy and inspiration of all others,
Unique for beauty in an age sublime.
Its foundations shall be builded,
Its gates of ivory, its dome;
With golden sunlight all its towers gilded
Shall cheer the pilgrim With the thought of home.
Come, my friends, the noise of War is dying,
Its clouds are melting to a peerless blue,
And everywhere are voices gaily crying:
Come brothers, let us make God's dream come true!
Come, let us help with deeds of love and pity
The toil~worn children in a world forlorn;
brothers, let us build the golden city;
Come, let us rear the temple of the morn!
