Shine on, Shine on! From out His late Epiphany
In the darkness of the night Shine on!

Let 11$ 100k, A ship is setting forth
Where God 113$ Set El $1811 f1"011l out To the la.nd of a race that is forming,
b00kl Thy light upon the Way,
$111116 011! Could ever seem to say:
Crest the 'Waves,

O'er the pure ones where they Walk, In the troubles of the World man is
through the World, born, 
Shine on. Shine on!
To their clean hearts afiame
From the altar of The Shine .on, Shine on, Shine on!
Gem the night O'er the gardens of the world, shine on
With thy light_' "The seed is in the fruit
shine On! The fruit is on the tree"
The gardener is the One of Blessed
Shine on, brilliant STAR, Shine on Mystery.
Thy ray of love will seem Shine on!
Even as Joaquin Miller in his beautiful poem to Columbus, "Sail On and
On and On," depicted the unthwarthable determination of the great explorer
to find a new material World, so has the STAR or TI-IE displayed upon its
pages the unquenchable eternal light of those mighty mariners of the 
the Blessed Perfection, Bans and the Center of the Covenant, Abdul-
whose fluent pens the beauty of the Ancient Ones has been re-
freshed and renewed. How they have made Jesus, the Son, as if again living
on the earth; how they have set aside the black clouds of prejudice that kept us
from appreciation of the Wonderful prophethood of Mohammed; how Moses
has arisen and talked to us~--a-ll through the power of these Brilliant Lights. Truly
have they made human brotherhood understandable, by pointing out that God
is One and His Creation one!
So Shine on, pages are sacred with Eternal Writings--whose
brilliant jewels are treasured in the hearts of men!
