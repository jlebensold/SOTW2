"We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations; that all
nations shall become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of aifection
and unity between the sons of men shall be strengthened; that diversity of religion 
shall cease and difierences of race be annulled. So it shall be. These fruitless strifes;
these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the 'Most Great Peace' shall comet"

FOUR leagues from Nazareth. Hush, here he lies,
Carmel his cenotaph, his home the skies.
Who, in his name, would dare to speak of death?
Abdul-Baha, the blessed, never dies.

Farewell to Haifa! Yonder crescent moon
Tells of a land where it is always June.
Our white-sailed ships, far-speeding, bear away
Into a life Where is no afternoon.
We have not lost our gifted prophet sage;
He has become the Spirit of the age;
A sea of love and purpose, power and thought
O'er which we reach our promised heritage.
It is not meet that we should grieve or Weep.
The restless billows swell and heave and heap,
Then rise in vapor to the sun to fall
In tears of rain where parched meadows sleep.
Now all our from the past,
With forward urging, far away we cast;
We burn our ships and climb along the stars,
Facing our steadfast future calm and vast.
