meditations are necessary in this memo-
rial service to day.
"As I caused you to weep yester-
day in his beautiful home, now it is
my duty to cause you to try and forget
your grief. I ask you to lessen your
heart sorrows and dry your tears. Yea,
Sir Abdul-Baha took his body away
from us, but he is living in his eternal
qualities and benevolence. Even if he
has departed, he has left for us from
the 'daughters' of his sublime ideas,
clear lessons; from his wonderful
teachings, instructive principles; from
his abundant bestowals, the grand heri-
tage; from his precious life, great ex-
amples of zeal, will power, patience,
firmness and the highest and noblest of
all virtues.
Gentlemen! There are some peo-
ple that live in their own pleasures;
others live in the soul of their own
kindred, nationality, race and creed 
but the one whom Palestine has lost,
has lived and will ever live in the souls
of the Orientals and Occidentals, in the
old world and in the new World. Yea,
his name will be remembered through-
out ages and centuries, by millions of
human beings both Persians and Arabs.
"If there is anyone who might doubt,
deny or forget the grace and station of
Abdul-Baha, let him recall that Abdul-
Baha was a lover of mankind, strongly
attached to all and the greatest worker
to vivify the world of humanity. This
is the foundation of all national, racial
and religious unity.
"He was the one who endured until
he changed the prison place-s into scien-
tific and art institutions, and the battle
fields into rooms of industries and right-
eousness. On his departure We have
learned that the realization of his sub-
lime aim is almost impossible at pres-
ent in this unjust World. Therefore, it
behooves the religious in their religion,
the nations in their countries, and the
scholars in their schools, to say: 'Mercy,
all the mercy, belong to Abdul-Baha
and all the misery to- the feeble huma11-
ity.' my God! Vi-Te beg for mercy,
which is the greatest comfort. Joy, and
joy be unto Abdul-Baha 
Dr. Kanlser Khoury recited his poem
in Arabic:
spirit of Abdul-Baha, peace be
unto thee!
Hover above us from thy lofty sta-
tion and shine!
Illumine this place because herein is
darkness;
Or descend from above and lead this
memorial service of the fortieth
day.
In the departure of Abdul-Baha there
is at dreadful vacancy.
Far from it can any leader fill this
vacancy!
Abdul-Baha, thou hast a supreme
place in eternity
And in thy sublime house (Shrine of
the Bab) there is a shrine!
The etfulgent shrine is shining here,
And its light, in the world, is eagerly
sought by the people.
Abdul-Baha, the glory of the Orient,
Appeared in an age wherein science
flourished and superstitions van-
ished.
Through him, nobility reached the
loftiest place;
Towards him the scholars raced;
His new moon appeared in the hori-
zon of Persia,
And thereby the minds became il-
lumined.
The signs of his zodiac multiplied un-
til he reached our horizon,
Wherein he stopped as a full moon.
While he walked, majesty followed
and virtue accompanied him;
Even skulls and bones bowed to him.
He lived among us in the Holy Land;
Therefore, souls and bodies are sacri-
ficed for the Holy Land.
family of Abdul-Baha! Weep not
for 
Because weeping is unlawful.
Whosoever has lived the life of
Abdul-Baha,
