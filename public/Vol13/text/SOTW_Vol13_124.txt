NEW BOOKS
BAI-IAI, THE on TI-IE AGE
Brentano's, New York.
The gifted Bahai thinker and poet,
Mr. Horace Holley, has presented in
this volume a brilliant introduction
to the Bahai movement from the point
of view of Western science and spirit-
ual aspirations. His introduction on
the "Cosmic Trinity" is a searching
philosophic argument to- prove the
reality of spiritual forces, the essen-
tial necessity of those master dyna-
moes called prophets o-r Manifesta-
tions if the cosmic energy of the divine
Will, Knowledge, Love is to- enter the
world of mankind, illumine our path
and move our social life up they glori-
ous highway of divine civilization.
The pages of the first third of the
volume are brilliant with the scien-
tific proofs of the reality of God and
His Manifestations and the ascent of
man toward "cosmic consciousness."
The remainder of the volume con-
tains dynamic selections from the
creative words of Baha'Ullah and
Abdul Baha, presenting with brief in-
troductions from the pen of the au-
thor the Bahai Message to Christian-
ity, to Judaism, to science, to poli-
tics and economics, to Christian
Science and New Thought, and to
Theosophy. The volume closes with
a chapter on "The Spirit of the
Age," "The Bahai Temple" and with
two priceless Bahai documents con-
cerning universal peace and the won-
ders of "the faculty of meditation"
when it "is bathed in the Inner Light
and characterized with divine attri-
butes."

Lnorunns OF JENABE FAZEL
The Seattle friends have published
five little volumes which contain the
addresses that Jenabe Fazel gave in
their city in the winter of 1921. The
little volumes are aglow with the wis-
dom of that "ideal sage" and are a
beautiful introduction to the heavenly
teachings. -"The New Vision of Im-
mortality" in volume five is a glori-
ous picture of the life of the spirit
in the unseen Kingdom. Scattered
through the pages are questions asked
at the various meetings and the bril-
liant answers of the spiritual philo-
sopher.
These little books present the most
great message with a universality and
a modern, western note that is a per-
petual refreshment. They reveal how
gloriously the beloved Jenabe Fazel
was confirmed to ignite in the lamps
of the west that universal light which
has dawned from the horizon of the
east.
Some of the subjects treated in the
different volumes are as follows:
Vol. 2--"Palestine in the Days of
Reconstruction"; "Solution of the
Economic Problem."
Vol. Universal Conscious-
ness of Christ"; "The Evolution of
the Idea of God in All Ages"; "Phy-
sical and Spiritual Healing"; "The
Proofs for the Recognition of the

ligions Are Identical"; "The True
Meaning of Trinity."

a i y" "Correspondence of

Key of Success"; "Universal Brother-
hood."
