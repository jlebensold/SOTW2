this power is assisted by the power of
God and that which is divinely assisted
must prevail. Consider how the Cause of
Christ was confirmed. How many re-
sisted it! What mountains of obstacles
were raised against it! What hostile forces
sought to destroy its foundations! Yet
the kings and emperors of the World could
not resist its spread and establishment.
No power of earth can Withstand the on-
flow of the spirit of truth. If 
kings and kingdoms come in its way it
will conquer, and they will be overthrown,
always: for your cause is truth itself, and
truth is omnipotent. If all nations arise
to oppose they will be vanquished, and
you will be victorious. You are a servant
of God, not a servant of this world. A
servant of God is he Who gives some
benefit to the world of man."
