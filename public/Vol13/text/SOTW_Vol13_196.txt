Amelia Von Ende, Writing on "Literary Zurich" in The Boolnnan, November, 1913,
states that "During the last two decades of the nineteenth century Zurich was much
frequented by the young men and Women who . . . attempted a 'revaluation' of all
values. Some were taking courses at the university, where men like Dr. Auguste Forel
opened to them vistas into unknown regions of the humanl soul, or suggested a new
reading of life. . . . To his influence Carl and Gerhart Hauptmann owe their
remarkable understanding of suffering humanity. His writings against alcoholism pro-
foundly impressed the younger generation."
