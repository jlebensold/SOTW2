*BAHAI TEMPLE
Designed by Louis Bomrgemls
A universal house of worship open to all sects and religions in the
spirit of universal brotherhood and dedicated to the oneness of God
and the oneness of mankind; now being built at Sheridan Road and
Linden Avenue, just north of Chicago, by those'in all parts of the World
who are working for universal religion, brotherhood and peace. Contribu-
tions are coming from all parts of America and Europe. They are also
being sent from Palestine, Syria, Egypt, Persia, India, Australia -and
Japan. Mirza Hadi, the father of Shoghi Effendi, writes that a sum of
nearly three hundred pounds has been recently sent from Haifa and Acca
although most of the friends there are Without work. As Abdul Baha has
said: "Such an event has never been witnessed by man that from the
farthermost country of Asia contributions were forwarded to the farther-
most country of America. . . . This is through the bounty and providence
of the Blessed Perfection, the assistance and confirmation of the Sun of
Truth and the victory and triumph of the Luminary of Efiulgence who
has united so marvelously the regions of the world together." "Truly, I
say, the friends of God displayed wonderful generosity in regard to the
contributions for the Mashreq-U1-Azkar. They displayed magnanilnity at
any cost to such an extent that some of them sold portions of their
clothing on the street. This is through the power of the Covenant of God."
