THE OF FAITH
By Horace Holley
THOSE who live in the depths of a
small, narrow valley, and make no
effort to climb the lofty mountains by
which they are people never
behold the landscape stretching beyond
the hills; they know not What the moun-
tains may conceal.
But he who makes the mighty effort,
leaving behind him the narrow valley of
human selfishness and ease; he Who has
the supreme courage and strength to gain
the summit, for him theiinvisible becomes
visible; for him the infinite divine hori-
zons are unfolded, and that which was
hidden behind the mountains is revealed.
One of those recurrent visions that
come again and again, Whenever selfish-
ness and greed and fear are truly over-
landscape which ever greets
with its beauty the soul Who reaches the
highest hill-is the vision of a united hu-
manity, a single faith, one Worship, one
law, one God. To this every traveler in
the World qt spirit has testified, and their
testimony ever agrees. We find this
vision singing in the Words of Isaiah;
Augustine, in his great Work "The City
of God" rediscovered it; its perception
haunted the great souls in the Middle
Ages; today once more the people of
magnanimity like Emerson have testified
eloquently that the same spiritual land-
scape still exists. You may search the
records of the vision of every people,
East and West, North and South--when
ever the soul becomes articulate, its
speech is the praise of that which it be-
holds before it, beyond the hills.
