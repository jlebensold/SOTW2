conditioned its publication upon the approval of the above-named Assembly.
This is so that things may be arranged in an orderly manner, for should it not
be so any one may translate a certain Tablet and print and circulate it on his
own account. Even a non~believer might undertake such Work, and thus cause
confusion and disorder. If it be conditioned however upon the app-roval of the
Spiritual Assembly, a translation prepared, printed and circulated by a non-
believer will have no recognition whatever."
This is indeed a clear indication of the Master 's express desire that nothing
whatever should be given to the public by any individual among the friends, un-
less fully considered and approved by the Spiritual Assembly in his locality;
and if this (as is undoubtedly the case) is a matter that pertains to the general
interests of the Cause in that land, then it is incumbent upon the Spiritual
Assembly to submit it to the consideration and approval of the National Body
representing all the various local assemblies. Not only with regard to publi-
cation, but all matters without any exception whatsoever, regarding the interests
of the Cause in that locality, individually or collectively, should be referred
exclusively to the Spiritual Assembly in that locality, which shall decide upon it,
unless it be a matter of national interest, in which case it shall be referred to
the National Body. With this National Body also will rest the decision whether
a given question is of local or national interest. (By national affairs is not
meant matters that are political in their character, for the friends of God the
world over are strictly forbidden to meddle with political affairs in any way
Whatever, but rather things that affect the spiritual activities of the body of the
friends in that land.)
Full harmony, however, as Well as cooperation among the various local
assemblies and the members themselves, and particularly between each assembly
and the National Body, is of the utmost importance, for upon it depends the
unity of the Cause of God, the solidarity of the friends, the full, speedy and
efficient Working of the spiritual activities of His loved ones.
Large issues in such spiritual activities that affect the Cause in gener.al
in that as the management of the STAR on THE and any period-
ical which the National Body may decide to be Bahai organ, the matter of
publication, of reprinting Bahai literature and its distribution among the
various assemblies, the means whereby the teaching campaign may be stimulated
and maintained, the work of the l\/lashreq 'Ul-Azkar, the racial question in rela-
tion to the Cause, the matter of receiving Orientals and association with them,
the care and maintenance of the precious film exhibiting a phase of the Master 's
sojourn in the United States of America as well as the original matrix and the
records of His voice, and various other national spiritual activities--far from
being under the exclusive jurisdiction of any local assembly or group of friends,
must each be minutely and fully directed by a special board, elected by the
National Body, constituted as a committee thereof, responsible to it and upon
which the National Body shall exercise constant and general supervision.
The time is indeed ripe for the manifold activities, wherein the servants
and hand-maids of BAHA are so devoutly and earnestly engaged, to be
harmonized and conducted with unity, cooperation and efficiency, that the efiect
of such a combined and systematized effort, through Which an All-Powerful
Spirit is ste.adily pouring, may transcend every other achievement of the past,
however glorious it has been, and may stand, now that to the eyes of the outside
