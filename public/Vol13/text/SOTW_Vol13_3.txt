"We desire but the good of the World and the happiness of
the nations; that all nations shall become one in faith, and all 
men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between
the sons of men shall be strengthened, that diversity of religion
shall cease, and differences of race be annulled. So it shall be.
These fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and 
the 'Most Great Peace' shall come." Words of BAHA
