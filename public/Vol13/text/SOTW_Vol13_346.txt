346 THE COMING ANNUAL CONVENTION
THE ANNUAL CONVENTION
IN AMERICA
A NIOST significant Convention in
the history of the Bahai Cause in
America will be held this spring, in Chi-
cago, at the Auditorium Hotel, beginning
April 28th. The Feast of the Rizwan will
occur Saturday evening, April 28th; the
public sessions of the Congress will be
held on the following Sunday afternoon
and on Monday, Tuesday and Wednes-
day evenings. The Convention sessions,
held in the mornings and afternoons, will
be attended by delegates and friends from
Assemblies all over America and, We
hope, by many friends from across the
seas.
The Committee is
planning to hold, if possible, some of the
sessions of the Convention in the great
foundation room of the 
Azkar at Wilmette, Illinois. There, al-
ready, the spiritual atmosphere of the
Kingdom is radiantly manifest, a fore-
taste of the coming glory, when all sects
and religions and peoples shall come to-
gether in unity and peace and worship
in this great universal Temple.
The day of spiritual organization, re-
vealed by Baha'U1lah and Abdul Baha in
many Tablets, is now gloriously ushered
into World-Wide activity by the Guardian
and Center of the Bahai Cause, Shoghi
Etiendi in Whom, today, the spirit of
Abdul Baha is shining in splendor and
Who, Abdul Baha tells us in his last Will
and Testament is under the unerring
guidance of God.
The coming Convention will rejoice to
meet under the banner and guidance of
our beloved Guardian who will lead the
Cause of Unity "to glorious victory".
We anticipate as a crowning event of
the Congress and Convention the pres-
ence of Jenabe Fazel, the distinguished
Bahai philosopher and scholar of Persia
who comes direct from the Holy Land
and from the presence of Shoghi Effendi.
A cablegram from the Guardian of the
Cause reads as follows: "Haifa. Alunt
Boston. Fazel and family arriving New
York February nineteen Adriatic. Shog-
hi."
Jenabe azel comes to America this
time with his wife and son, Hoshang,
for a visit of a number of years. His
many, many friends in America are Wait-
ing eagerly to hear again his eloquent
message and meet once more this apostle
of the universal love of Abdul Baha.
