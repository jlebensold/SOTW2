the little children and for the flowers
and of his generosity and care for the
poor and suffering. So gentle was he,
and so simple, that in his presence one
almost forgot that he was also a great
teacher, and that his writings and his
conversations have been a solace and
an inspiration to hundreds and thou-
sands of people in the East and West.
"It is possible to regard his teaching
in many lights. Some may say that it
did merely reassert truths which form
the basis of all religious teachings.
Some may declare that it was prema-
ture and impractical, but everybody
can appreciate the beauty of his ideals
and agree that if the doctrine of uni-
versal brotherhood Was carried out this
world would be a better and a happier
place.
"To us who have just passed through
the throes of one of the fiercest wars in
the history of mankind, and whose
minds and lives are still disturbed~
words of peace and goodwill sound al-
most strange upon our ears. We find
it difiicult to credit them, but every-
where men of many nations and of di-
verse creeds proclaim the imperative
needs of peace. The conscience and
imagination of mankind have been
stirred and there is a widespread hope
that one by one the conflicting inter-
ests and misunderstandings that pro-
mote strife and hatred will be removed,
and that better and more friendly rela-
tions will prevail between the nations,
between communities and between indi-
viduals. Whenever these better times
come we may be sure that the name of
Abdul-Baha who lived among us here
in Haifa, will be remembered with grati-
tude and aitectionate esteem."
-The poet, Waalie Effencli Bestani,
gave the following recitation.'
"Palestine knows what has befallen

But she is so stricken that she is un-
able to speak.
THE WEST
I am her heart and her tongue;
Her earth and heaven inspire me.
Why should I scatter pearls of tears
on the earth
When the stars are perfectly set in
the sky?
Death has not beclouded the light
of Abdul-Baha!
He is smiling in the Most Glorious
(Abha) horizon.
They called him a 
Christians and l\/loslems fall in love
with him.
You may ask the Occident about him,
For though he is the Master in the
Orient,
Supreme and great is he in the great
West.
You may question the Kaiser and the
crumbling thrones and 
Where are the pillars and the
geniuses of the people'?
All will fail to answer--
Oh, Abdul-Baha!
Who will guide the astray who are
groping in the dark?
Oh, ye who are commemorating
Abdul-Baha,
Mention ye His Words!
Oh, ye who are commemorating
Abdul-Baha,
Gomprehend ye His ideals!"
Yoassif Effendi El-Kahtib spoke as
follows.'
"It seems to me no matter how deeply
I try to think, I cannot find a way to
express what is concealed in my mind.
Poets and orators, even if they speak,
are far from it, far from it. Can they
utter words to be compared with the
eloquence of your silence and acquies-
cence?
declare by my life, this makes me
firmly believe that Abdul-Baha, after
remaining four scores of years in this
world, teaching with his thought, guid-
