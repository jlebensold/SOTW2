Hasten ye toward the law of disarma-
mentl
Hasten ye toward harmony and suc-
cess!
Hasten ye toward co-operation and Inu-
tual help in the path of guidance."
ABDUL Bans.
Our age cries for the fulfillment of
the vision oi John on Patmos when "a
multitude which no man could number,
out of every nation and of all kindreds
and peoples and tongues" shall arise
before the throne of God, arrayed in the
white robes of pure intentions and u11i-
versal love, dedicated to the establish-
ment of a universal society of nations, a
universal peace. To join this army of
the most great peace one must first be
equipped with the heavenly teachings;
secondly, try to practice them in his own
life and then spread them by loving',
selfless deeds and radiant words among
the people.
To listen to the divine call and sense
the Kingdom, "this," writes Abdul
Baha, "is the first step in the path of
God, but the distance of the way is
great. . . . That pathway is that
of
Severance from the world-tie;
Reliance upon God;
Baptism_ through spirit and fire;
Attainment to the spirit of the knowl-
edge of God;
Conflagration with the fire of the love
of God;
Trustworthiness 
Faithfulness and firmness in the
Covenant;
Steadfastness in the Cause, and,
Service to the Kingdom of Peace
which shall soon establish its tent
in the center of the world."
ye my soldiers of the Kingdom!"
calls Abdul Baha. "Be ye valiant and
fearless! Day by day add to your spir-
itual victories. Be ye not disturbed by
the constant assaults of the enemies.
Attack ye like unto the roaring lions.
Have no thought of yourselves, for the
invisible armies of the Kingdom are
113
fighting on your side. Enter ye the bat-
tlefield with the Confirmations of the
Holy Spirit. Know ye of a certainty
that the powers of the Kingdom of Abha
are with you. The hosts of the heaven
of Truth are with you. The cool breezes
of the Paradise of Abha are waiting
over your heated brows. Not for a
moment are ye alone. Not for a second
are ye left to yourselves. The Beauty
of Abha is with you. The Glorious God
is with you. The King of Kings is with
you." -
CAN VVE CHANGE HUMAN

A BAI-IAI CONVERSION.
ALL programs for world peace, for
economic right and justice depend
for their execution upon the creation of
a new heart in our race of human
beings, "the establishment of the King-
dom of God first in the hearts of men
and then upon earth." To educate this
new humanity is the supreme need of
the century. Because Baha 'Ullah and
Abdul Baha are able to train that new
type of men and women by the divine
elixir of their life and teachings they
have made this century radiant with the
hope of a new world-society in which
dwelleth righteousness.
An instance of this power is recorded
by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab when he was
living at Haifa. It is an account of the
conversion of at Russian highwayman
who visited Abdul Baha in the Holy
L-and in 1914. "Before he accepted this
revelation he was well-known in all
those parts as a dangerous character
whose very name struck terror to the
heart of the members of the community.
It may be an exaggeration, but I have
heard from several persons that, in his
former whirlwind desperado life he
killed about two hundred people. Phy-
sically he is a giant, tall and powerfully
built. Well, when this man embraced
the Bahai Cause and learned of its lofty
and spiritual principles a most miracu-
