STAR OF THE WEST 75
Song of the Holy Mariner
Revealed by His Holiness BAHA 
(Note the following instructions given by Shoghi Effendi: "\/Vhere the
asterisks are placed the following chorus or burden of the song is every
time repeated: 'Glorifiecl be my Lord, the All-Glorious!' After the last three
verses of the song the chorus is as follows: 'Glorified be our Lord, the Most
High!' 
He is the Gracious, the Well-beloved!
Holy Mariner!
Bid thine ark of eternity appear before the Celestial Concourse, 
Launch it upon the ancient sea, in His Name, the Most Wondrous, 
And let the angelic spirits enter, in the Name of God, the Most High. 
Unmoor it, then, that it may sail upon the ocean of glory, 
Haply the dwellers therein may attain the retreats of nearness in the ever-
lasting realm. 
Having reached the sacred strand, the shore of the crimson seas, 
Bid them issue forth and attain this ethereal invisible station, 
A station wherein the Lord hath in the Flame of His Bounty appeared within
the deathless tree; 
"Therein the embodiments of His Cause cleansed themselves of self and
passion; 
Around which the Glory of Moses doth circle with the everlasting hosts; 
\/Vherein the Hand of God was drawn forth from His bosom of Grandeur 
Wherein the ark of the Cause remaineth motionless even though to its
dwellers be declared all divine attributes. 
Mariner I
Teach them that are within the ark that which we have taught thee behind
the mystic veil, 
Perchance they may not tarry in the sacred snow-white spot, 
But may soar upon the wings of the spirit unto that station which the Lord
hath exalted above all mention in the worlds below, 
May wing through space even as the favored birds in the realm of eternal
reunion; 
May know the mysteries hidden in the seas of light. 
They passed the grades of limitations and reached that of the
divine unity, the center of heavenly guidance.
