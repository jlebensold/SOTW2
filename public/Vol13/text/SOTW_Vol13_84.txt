out the American the friends should in their words and con-
duct emphasize and give absolute prominence to the constructive dynamic
principles of BAI-IA rather than attach undue importance to His negative
Teachings. With hearts cleansed from the least. trace of suspicion and filled
with hope and faith in what the spirit of love can achieve, we must one and
all endeavor at this moment to forget past impressions, and with absolute good-
will and genuine cooperation unite in deepening and diffusing the spirit of love
and service that the Cause has thus farso remarkably shown to the world. To
this attitude of good will, of forbearance and genuine kindness to all, must be
added, however, constant but unprovocative vigilance, lest unrestricted associa-
tion with the peoples of the world should enable the very few who have been
definitely pronounced by the Master as injurious to the body of the Cause, to
make a breach in the Movement. Not until, however, an unmistakable evidence
should appear, manifestly revealing the evil motives of a certain individual or
group of individuals, is it advisable to make the matter public; for an un-
timely declaration that shall give rise to open differences among the friends is
far more detrimental than forbearing still further with those who are suspected
of evil intentions. As the Master so fully and consistently did throughout His
lifetime, we must all make a supreme eifort to pour out a genuine spirit of kind-
ness and hopeful love to peoples of various creeds and classes, and must abstain
from all provocative language that may impede the effect of what true and
continued kindness can produce.
Does not Abdul-Baha wish us, as he looks down upon us with loving ex-
pectation from his glorious Station, to obliterate as much as possible all traces
of censure, of conflicting discussions, of cooling remarks, of petty unnecessary
observations that impede the onward march of the Cause, that damp the zeal of
the firm believer and detract from the sublimity of the B-ahai Cause in the eyes
of the inquirer? In order, however, to insure fair and quick and vigorous action
whenever such an evil activity is revealed and has been carefully ascertained, the
best and only means would appear to be, for the careful observer, once he is
assured of such an evil action, and has grown hopeless of the attitude of kind-
ness and forbearance, to report it quietly to the Spiritual Assembly representa-
tive of the friends in that locality and submit the case to their earnest and full
consideration. Should the majority of the members of that Assembly be con-
scientiously convinced of the this being a national issue affecting the
body of the friends in America--it should, only through the intermediary of
that Assembly, be cautiously communicated to that greater body representing
all the Assemblies in America, which will in its turn obtain all the available data
from the local Assembly in question, study carefully the situation and reserve
for itself the ultimate decision. It may, if it decides so, refer it to the Holy
Land for further consideration and consultation.
This clearly places heavy responsibilities on the local as well as the national
Assemblies, which in the course of time will evolve, with the Master's power and
guidance, into the local and national Houses of Justice. Hence the vital neces-
sity of having a local Spiritual Assembly in every locality where the number
of adult declared believers exceed nine, and of making provisions for the indirect
election of a Body that shall adequately represent the interest of all the friends
and Assemblies throughout the American Continent.
