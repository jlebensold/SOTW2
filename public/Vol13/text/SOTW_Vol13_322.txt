25PRAYER OF ABDUL BAHA
Translated by Shoghi Effendi
In The Name of God, the l\/lost High
and glorified art Thou, Lord
God Omnipotent! Thou before Whose
i- I Wisdom the wise falleth short and
ii falleth, before Whose knowledge the
1 learned confesseth his ignorance be-
 7
2 fore Whose might the strong Waxeth
1* weak, before Whose wealth the rich
testifieth to his poverty, before Whose
light the enlightened is lost in darkness, toward the
Shrine of Whose knowledge turneth the essence of all
understanding and the Sanctuary of Whose Presence
circle the souls of all mankind.

 
How then can I sing and tell of Thine Essence, which
the wisdom of the wise and the learning of the learned
have failed to comprehend, inasmuch as no man can sing
that which he understandeth not, nor recount that unto
which he cannot attain, whilst Thou hast been from ever-
lasting the Inaccessible, the Unsearchable. Powerless
though I be to rise to the Heavens of Thy Glory and
soar in the Realms of Thy Knowledge, I can but recount
Thy tokens that tell of Thy Glorious Handiwork.
By Thy Glory! beloved of all hearts, Thou that
alone canst still the pangs of yearning for Thee! Though
all the dwellers of Heaven and earth unite to glorify the
least of Thy Signs, wherein and whereby Thou hast re--
vealed Thyself, yet would they fail, how much more to
praise Thy Holy Word, the creator of all Thy Tokens.
All praise and glory be to Thee, Thou of whom all
things have testified that Thou art One and there is none
other God but Thee, who hast been from everlasting
exalted above all peer or likeness and to everlasting shalt
remain the same. All Kings are but Thy servants and
all beings, visible and invisible, as naught before Thee.
There is none other God but Thee, the Gracious, the
Powerful, the l\/lost High1'13
