76 STAR OF THE WEST
They have desired to ascend unto that state Which the Lord hath ordained
to be above their stations. 
Whereupon the burning meteor cast them out from them that abide in the
Kingdom of His Presence, 
And they heard the Voice of Grandeur raised from behind the unseen
pavilion upon the Height of Glory: 
guardian angels! Return them to their abode in the World below, 
"Inasmuch as they have purposed to rise to that sphere which the wings of
the celestial dove have never attained; 
"\Vhereon the ship of fancy standeth still Which the minds of them that
comprehend cannot grasp." 
Whereupo-11 the maid of heaven looked out from her exalted chamber, 
And with her b-row signed to the Celestial Concourse, 
Flooding With the light of her countenance the heaven and the earth, 
And all beings Were shaken in their mortal graves. 
She then raised the call which no ear through all eternity hath ever 
And thus proclaimed: "By the Lord! He Whose heart hath not the fra-
grance of the love of the exalted and glorious Arabian Youth, 
"Can in no Wise ascend unto the glory of the highest heaven." 
Thereupon she summoned unto herself one maiden from her 
And commanded her: "Descend into space from the mansions of eternity,**i*
"And turn thou unto that Which they have concealed in the inmost of their
hearts. 
"Shouldst thou inhale the perfume of the robe from the Youth that hath
been hidden Within the tabernacle of light by reason of that which the hands of
the Wicked have wrought, 
'Raise a cry within thyself, that all the inmates of the chambers of Paradise,
that are the embodiments of the eternal Wealth, may understand and hearken 
"That they may all come down from their everlasting chamibers and
tremble, 
"And kiss their hands and feet for having soared to the heights of faith-
fulness; 
"Perchance they may find from their robes the fragrance of the beloved
One." 
Thereupon the countenance of the favored damsel beamed above the celestial
chambers even as the light that shineth from the face of the Youth above his
mortal temple.
