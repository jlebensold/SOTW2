BAHAI CONGRESSES 281
carried home with them thefragrances
of the Abha Kingdom.
Vienna, Austria, was represented by
Mr. Franz Pallinger who, always having
been a searcher for truth, received the
Bahai teachings at Stuttgart. Since his
return to Vienna he has been untiring in
his efforts to promote the Cause of God
and now there are several centers in that
c1tV.
Shortly before his ascension Abdul
Baha Wrote to Mr. Pallinger the follow-
ing beautiful Tablet:
To Mr. Franz Pallinger--upon him be
the light of God, the Most Luminous.
Care of Lady Bloomfield--upon her be
the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.
is Godl
thou who art thirsty for the water of
Heavenly Life!
Thy letter has been received. Its con-
tents imparted great joy because they
were expressive of firmness and stead-
fastness.
I feel great kindness toward thee and
supplicate eternal endearment and ever-
lasting life for thee so that thou mayest
in those regions raise the call of the
Kingdom, delivering the people from the
obscurities of the world of nature through
the light of guidance, that thou mayest,
like the Egyptian messenger, become the
bearer of the garment of the heavenly
Joseph, giving light to the eyes of the
Jacobs and perfuming nostrils with the
fragrances of the mantle of the Joseph
of the Kingdom.
Give the divine Glad Tidings to the
friends in Vienna, so that they may attain
to eternal blessings, obtain new life and
acquire limitless rapture and joy.
These regions are greatly in need of
the heavenly Glad Tidings because all
have, through the severity of the calami-
ties of the war, become disappointed,
withered, faded and almost dead. So
they are in need of the breath of life.
This breath of life is simply the heavenly
Glad Tidings. Nothing can relieve them
from this sorrow, grief, depression, dis-
appointment except the divine Glad Tid-
ings.
(Signed) Abdul Baha Abbas.
