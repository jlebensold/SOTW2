WORDS OF ABDUL-BAHA
"Great importance must be given to the development of the Star of the West.
The circle of its discussion must be widened; iniits columns must be published the
essential problems pertaining to the Bahai life in all its phases. Its contents must be
so universal that even the strangers may subscribe to it. Articles must be published
dealing with the universal principles of the Cause, the writers proving that this Cause
takes a vital interest in all the social and religious movements of the age and is con-
ducive to the progress of the world and its inhabitants. In short, the Star of the West
must'promote the aspirations and the ideals that will gather little by little around
these general Tablets, bringing into the light of day all the historical, religious
and racial knowledge which will be of the utmost value to the Bahai teachers all
over the wor1d."
From "Unveiling of the Divine Plan."
