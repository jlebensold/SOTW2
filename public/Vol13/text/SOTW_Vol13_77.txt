STAR OF THE WEST 77
She then descended With such an adorning as to illumine the heavens and
all that is therein. 
She bestirred herself and perfumed all things in the land of holiness and
grandeur. 
When she reached that plane she rose to her full height in the midmost of
creation, 
And sought to inhale their fragrance at a time that knoweth neither begin-
ning nor end. 
She found not in them that which she did desire, and this verily is but one
of His wondrous tales. 
She then cried aloud, Wailed and repaired to her own station Within her
most lofty mansion, 
And then gave utterance to one mystic Word, Whispered privily by her
honied tongue, 
And raised the call amidst the Celestial Concourse and the immortal maids
of heaven: 
"By the Lord! I found not from these idle claimants the breeze of Faith-
fulness. 
"By the Lord! The Youth hath remained lone and forlorn in the land of
exile in the hands of the ungodly." 
She then uttered within herself such a cry that the Celestial Concourse did
shriek and tremble, 
And she fell upon the dust and gave up the spirit. It seemeth she was
called and hearkened unto Him that summoned her unto the Realm on High. 
Glorified be He that created her out of the essence of love in the midmost
heart of His exalted paradise 
Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious.'
Thereupon the maids of heaven hastened forth from their chambers, upon
Whose countenances the of no dweller in the highest paradise had ever
gazed. 
They all gathered around her, and lo! they found her body fallen upon
the dust; 
And as they beheld her state and comprehended a Word of the tales of the
Youth, they bared their heads, rent their garments asunder, beat upon their
faces, forgot their joy, shed tears and smote with their hands upon their cheeks,
and this is verily one of the mysterious grievous aiflictions--
Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!
