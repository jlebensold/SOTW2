God, loved and adored in His Oneness and
Singleness by all the children of men. We have
come to you for new inspiration and new light,
and to bring to you somewhat of that unity,
and harmony, that has prevailed in all this
work thus tar. We are here for spiritual con-
sultation; for guidance; to arouse the energies,
to awaken the sleeping and move the hearts
and hands to livelier interest, to greater work,
to more effort and sacrifice.

Kalanter, of Persia, consent to represent that
sacred land as a delegate in this Unity from
that country?
