HE IS 
ye children of the Kingdom."
It is New Year; that is to say, the rounding of the cycle of the year.
A year is the expression of a cycle (of the sun) but now is the beginning
of a cycle of Reality, a New Cycle, a New Age, a New Century, a New
Time and a cw Year. Therefore, it is very blessed.
I wish this blessing to appear and become manifest in the faces and
characteristics of the believers, so that they, too, may become a new
people, and having found new life and been baptized with fire and spirit,
may make the world a new world, to the end that the old earth may dis~
appear and the new earth appear; old ideas depart and new thoughts
come; old garments be cast aside and new garments put on; ancient
politics whose foundation is war, be discarded and modem politics founded
on peace, raise the standard of victory; the new star shine and gleam and
the new sun illumine and radiate; new flowers bloom; the new spring
become known; the new breeze blow; the new bounty descend; the New
Tree give forth new fruit; the new voice become raised and this new sound
reach the ears, that the new will follow the new, and all the old furnishings
and adornments bieicast aside and new decorations put in their places.
I desire for you all that you will have this great assistance and par-
take of this great bounty, and that in spirit and heart you will strive and
endeavor until the world of war become the world of peace; the world of
darkness the world of light; satanic conduct be turned into heavenly be-
havior; the ruined places become built up; the sword be turned into the
olive branch; the flash of hatred become the flame of the love of Cod
and the noise of the gun the voice of the Kingdom; the soldiers of death
the soldiers of life; all the nations of the world one nation; all races as
one race; all national anthems harmonized into one melody.
Then this material realm will be Paradise, the earth Heaven, and
the world of satan become the world of angels.
