give Christ's Message to the world. The great
Christian civilization (the bounties of which
the people of the world are now enjoying) hacl
its birth or main spring in the Revelation of
Jesus, and its spiritual quickening in those
Who, like Peter, recognized Jesus to be "The
Christ, the Son of The Living God"; whereas
those souls who were merely attracted to
Jesus and before really believing slipped away
from The Cause, played no part in the great
organic growth of Christianity.
So it is again in this day of revelation. How
many souls are attracted to Abdul--Baha. How
many crowd to see him and to hear him, yet
the real blessing is that of realizing in him
The Center of God's Covenant.
From the following quotation from the
"Tablet of the Branch," revealed by BAHA-
the importance of this matter will be
clearly understood:
ye people! draw nigh unto it [The
Branch (The Center of The Covenant, Abdul-
Baha)] and taste the fruits of its knowledge
and wisdom on the part of The Mighty, The
Knowing One. Whosoever will not taste
thereof shall be dejariverl of The Bounty, even
though he hath partaleen of all that is in the
ye of those who know. . . .
Say, people, praise ye God for its manifesta-
tion [The Branch] for verily The Branch
[Abdul-Baha] is the most great power upon
you, and the most perfect blessing upon you,"
and through Him every mouldering bone is
quic/eened. hosoever turns unto Him hath
surely turned unto God, and whosoever turneth
away from Him hath turned away from My
Beauty, cleniecl hf Proof, and is of those who
transgress. Verity, He is the Remembrance of
God amongst you, and His Trust within you,

and His Manifestation unto you, and His ap-
pearance among the servants who are nigh.
Thus have I been commanded to convey to you
The Message of God, your Creator; and I have
delivered unto you that of which I was COWL-
mended."
Following this and other similar commands
revealed by the true and firm
Bahais have turned with implicit faith towards
Abdul-Baha, The Branch, The Center of The
Covenant, in whom they find their illumina-
tion, their guidance, their strength, their hope,
their all.
THEREFORE, RECOGNIZING IN AB-
DUL-BAHA THE CENTER OF 
COVENANT, IS, IN THIS DAY, THE
ONE ALL-IMPORTANT MATTER BE-
FORE THE WORLD, FOR IN HIM IS
THE POWER OF THE COVENA-NT OF
GOD, VVHICH ALONE IS TO REGEN-
ERATE MANKIND.

The difficulties and problems of an assem-
bly will solve themselves when everyone con-
centrates their faith in The Center of The
Covenant. Study "The Tablet of The Branch"
and Abdul-Baha's address upon "The Cove-
nant" given in New York City, Iune I9, I912,
and also his Tablet upon "The Covenant."
These latter were published in 'Washington,
D. C., in pamphlet form, They can be ob-
tained by writing to the Washington assembly.
My love and greetings to all the friends.
Yours in The Center of The Covenant,
