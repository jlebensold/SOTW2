TABLET FROM ABDUL-B-AHA.
thou Star of the West! an IS con!
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long, thou shalt
become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper of the
Bahais which 15 organized in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are limited,
thy fo:rm_ JS small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakable, become the object of the attention
of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the Covenant, in the
future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto the waves of the sea; thy volume will increase, thy
arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will he raised and become world-wide--and at last
thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these depend upon firmness, firinness,
firmness! (Signed) ABDUL-BAHA Asms.

must continue to keep the Nineteen-Day
Feast. It is very important; it is very good.
But when you present yourselves in the meet-
ings, beforc entering them, free yourselves
from all that you have in your heart, free
your thoughts and your minds from all else
save God, and speak to your heart. That all
may make this a gathering of love, make it
the cause of illumination, make it a gathering
of attraction of the hearts, surround this
gathering with the Lights of the Supreme
Concourse, so that you may be gathered to-
gether with the utmost love.
God! Dispel all those elements which
are the cause of discord, and prepare for us
all those things which are the cause of unity
and accord! Godl Descend upon us
Heavenly Fragrance and change this gather-
ing into a gathering of Heaven! Grant to
us every benefit and every food. Prepare for
once in nineteen days, usually
on the first of each Bahai month.
The first day of each Bahai month falls as follows:

us the Food of Love! Give to us the Food
of Knowledge! Bestow upon us the Food of
Heavenly Illumination!
In your hearts rem-ember these Th-z'ngs, and
then. enter the Unity Feast.
Each one of you must think how to make
happy and pleased the other members of your
Assembly, and each one must consider all
those who are present as better and greater
than himself, and each one must consider
himself less than the rest. Know their sta-
tion as high, and think of your own station
as low. Should you act and live according to
these behests, know verily, of a certainty,
that that Feast is the Heavenly Food. That
Supper is the "Lord's Supper!" I am the
Servant oi that gathering.
