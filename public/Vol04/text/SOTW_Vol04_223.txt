The Society is approved by Abdul-Baha, who
has repeatedly urged its importance--partic-
ularly in the matter of keeping up the scholar~
ships. The eyes of the Orient are upon us, he
says, to the end that America may keep its
promises in this respect.
Every cent of the $18.00 annual scholarship
payments goes to Persia.

IS HOPED A RADIANT PALACE MAY BE PREPARED FOR 
Recent Tablet from Abdul~Baha to a Christian Minister at Washington, D. C.
HE is con!
respected personage, thou seeker of Reality!
Thy letter was received. It was not a letter
but a mirror in which was reflected the images
of Reality. Therefore, through its reading and
perusal the happiness of the heart was obtained.
If the house is destroyed, be thou not
the palace of the Kingdom be up-
raised!
thou bird of Reality! If thy terrestial
nest is ruined, be thou not heav-
enly nest is destined for thee. His Holiness,
the Christ, the Holy Manifestations and the
apostles possessed no nest whatsoever in this
mortal world but in the universe of God, a
glorious palace. It is hoped that through the
Divine Bestowal, in a lofty station, in the uni-
verse of God, a radiant palace may become pre-
pared for thee.
Consider that the palaces of former kings,
from the day of Adam to the present time, are
destroyed and ravaged by the relentless hand
of time, but the towering palace of the believers
of God are eternally built and never subject to
destruction. Reflect carefully and -thou shalt
observe that all the foundations are uprooted
but the foundation of the apostles of Jesus,
which is becoming firmer and loftier day by
day.
It is my hope that thou shalt likewise lay the
basis of such a lofty palace. The foundation
of this palace is to summon the people to the
Call of the Kingdom of God; its galleries are
the Principles of and its decora-
tions the writings of the World of'huma,nity;
its radiant lamps are the lights of the Divine
Kingdom.
Therefore, strive as much as thou canst to
quicken the dead souls, to guide the erring
ones, to cause to drink those who are thirsty
and invite those Who are hungry to sit around
the heavenly table and partake of the Divine
Food.
Upon thee be 
(Signed) ABDUL BAHA A1212./as.
