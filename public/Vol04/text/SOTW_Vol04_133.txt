going to interrupt any regular proceedings
here, because God moves in hearts. Speak it
out. The two suggestions thrown out have
been good. We will take action on the subject
as a body, but for the present I think it advis-
able to get all the views before us.
The next business is the report of the
Treasurer.

THE CHAIRMAN: I take it that it is the
sense of the meeting that the two reports of
the Financial-Secretary and the Treasurer,
just made by Mrs. True, be referred to an
auditing committee.
[The Chairman appointed Mr. Lunt, Mrs.
Ober and Mr. Hoar]
MR. MILLSI While on the subject of
finances, I think it would help the friends in
considering plans, if we could hear definitely
what Abdul~Baha's plan is, or what he has said
about the matter. Was not something said
about the land being worth $70,000 and a
mortgage being put on it? Has Abdul-Baha
expressed himself about that?
MRS. TRUE: Yes.
THE CHAIRMAN: If there is any doubt
about it in your minds, we will hear from Mr.
Willielm on that.
MR. WILHELMI There was some question
about that. Mrs. True seemed to .be some-
what disturbed over it. I think Abdul-Baha
felt that unless we were more 
Now it is all very nice to talk about what we
have done and look at that $50,000, but when
We stop to think of it, it means that we
have not given a dollar apiece--since we
have heard this n1essage--a year. Now what
we have accomplished is not had under the
circumstances, but if I properly understood
Abdul-Baha, my impression as we talked about
encourages us as a rule in whatever
we do, fair, bad or middling, he tries to en-
courage rather than discourage-Hbut I thought
I could see a trace of disappointment on his
face on more than one occasion, that we had
not done a great deal more. Mrs. True and
one or two of the others may bear me out in
this, and Mrs. Kinney. "Tell, undoubtedly
some of you have sensed the same thing. I
don't know that he said so in so many words,
though private
what made me feel quite sheepish; he didn't
say it directly to me but I caught the drift
of the meaning. Something was said about
paying for the main tract at once or we would
lose it. Mrs. True said, "Well, she thought
they might sell the lake shore tract in order to
raise the money to pay for the main tract."
said, "If it is necessary, yes, pay for the
main tract before it gets away from you." It
will just show some of you who have not been
on the tract, it you will imagine these two
banners [pointing to two banners on the wall]
as the main tract, the two upper banners would
be the little strip bordering on the lake. Well,
