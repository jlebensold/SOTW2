MASHRAK-EL-AZKAR CONVENTION TO BE HELD IN CHICAGO
[Continued from page 320]
ing all; also that the Convention will be held
in Chicago this year and the information per-
taining thereto.
The east of America was blest last year by
the Conrvention held in New York city, and
the west will receive an outpouring of the
Spirit when the Convention of 1915 is held in
San willing; so the Executive
Board felt the middle west was entitled to the
Convention this year.
It was thought a jubilee celebration might
be held in gratitude for the accomplishment of
clearing th-e sacred land of the Maskrak-el-
Azkar from all indebtedness, for surely, as the
friends gather on the land dedicated by the
hands of the Great Orb of The Covenant and
purchased by the voluntary contributions
poured into the heart of this continent from
all the countries of the globe, a pe-nticostal
baptism must pour out upon the hearts of those
who gather at the site of the "m-other" Masth-
rak-el-Azkar.
The members p-resent at this session were
Messrs. Hall, Wilhelm, Ashton, Iacobsen and
Mesdames Parmerto-n and True. T-he last
day's sessi-on was favored by a visit from Mr.
Rals-to-n, of Sa-n P'-r'an'cisco "wlho was
passing through Chicago on his way home from
the east.
A balance of $1,800.00 was in the treasury.
CORINNE TRUE, Financial Secretary.

ESPERANTO
To our many Bahai friends who would re-
spond to the earnest appeal of Abdul-Baha to
learn the International Language we would
say that with the aid of the Jones' Esperanto
Manual (25c) used hand in hand with the
new propaganda journal, The Esperanto
Volume I, Es-p-eranto can be thor-
oughly learned with or without a teacher.
Owing to its masterful simplicity, lo-gical
construction, and use of international roots at
once recognized by the student, thousands
throughout the world learn the language alone
and are enabled to correspond with their fel-
lowmen the world over.
The United States Esperanto Association
(Miss I. E. I-Iamand, Secretary, Schaller, 
can supply the. text-books mentioned and is
ready and anxious to render every possible
service to all who des-ire to study the language.
