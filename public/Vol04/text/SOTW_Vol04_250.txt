 you are sincere in your love for me, then love and serve the be-
I lievers of God; then love and serve your fellow-men.
These days, I do not feel very well. My remedy is to hear that
the believers love each other. Any other news makes me sick and un-
happy. Let everyone speak to me about love and I will love him more.
The friends must be real peacemakers; not stirrers up of strife nor
sowers of seeds of discord, nor acting with siuperiority one over an-
other.
I am now growing old. O, very old! All through my life I have
carried on my back, gladly, the burdens of the believers; but now I
ever anticipate hearing the good news of service actually accomplished
by them. Save this, I have no other joy in the world.
Will they not make me happy?
Will they not answer my call, when the shad-ow of the last night
of my life is falling slowly across my path?
Will they not arise with superhuman energy and united effort to
spread the Cause and impart to me new vigor?
Will they not li.sten to me?
How my he-art leaps with joy when I hear the friends love each
other, always overlooking one another's small mistakes; and that they
are forgiving their enemies!
