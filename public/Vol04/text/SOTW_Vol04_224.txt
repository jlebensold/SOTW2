Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to re_main firm and eternal, ere long, thou shalt
become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper of the
Bahais which is organized in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are limited,
thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakable, become, the object of the attention
of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the Covenant, in the
future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto the waves of the sea; thy volume willincrease, thy

thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these de end upon fifmflei-Y.

AUTHORSHIP OF WRITINGS OF ATTRIBUTED
TO SOMEONE ELSE.
IN A LETTER just received from Mirza
Ahmad Sohrab, Ramleh, Egypt, he writes
as follows:
"Enclosed you will find Mr. August J. Sten~
strand's pamphlet, Call to Behaists, N0. 
which, as you know, is full of mistakes and
unqualified falsehood, the author in such a
shameless manner attributing the "Iglian,"

putable Tablets and Books of be-
