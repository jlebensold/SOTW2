STAR OF THE WEST 221
PERSIAN-AMERICAN   
EDUCATIONAL
SOCIETY.
R. S. I. MOODY, the representative of
the Society in Teheran, has recently sent
in the yearly averages of the scholars in
the Tarbiat schools, which are appended. She
reports that a very earnest effort is being made
to establish higher grades. Two societies have
offered to assist materially. Mahfil Morateb
offer one hundred tomans per month (about
$100.00) for four months, and Hahfil Fashdigh
offer seven tomans per month for one year.
Dr. Moody has subscribed fifty tomans and
also pays one toman per month on rent of the
girls' school. During the last year she has
also paid forty tomans rent for Dabestan Doos-
hezigan Vatan School. Thus the wide-awake
condition and earnestness at that end of the
line is proven.
The young men of Persia who need ad-
vanced work should also be cared for in our
own school. It is earnestly hoped that a
highly qualified man be sent out soon.
It appears that the information given in the
report published recently about the examina-
tions at the University, was based upon a mis-
apprehension. The correct figures were 21
boys of Tarbiat School received diplomas; 59
boys from all other schools.
