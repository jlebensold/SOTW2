TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
To the beloved of God and the maid-servants
of the Merciful in Stuttgart and Esslingen,
Germany.
Upon them be 
HE IS con!
jve dear sons and beloved do-ughters of
A bdui-Baha!
When the days that I was your associate and
intimate, pass before the mind, the heart is
stirred into cheertulness. \Nhat blessed days
they were! What radiant nights they Were!
They 'will never be forgotten.
"With the memory of you every morning I
arise and every evening I raise the song of
supplication toward the Kingdom of ABHA
and beg assistance and confirmation for you.
I hope that, in Stuttgart, the Ensign of Signs
may become unfurled, and the fire of the love
of God may send forth such flames as will en-
lighten all around; that each one of those
blessed souls may become like unto a lamp
difliusing the light oi guidance in all direc-
tions.
I send to those parts his honor, Mirza Ali
Akbar, and his honor, Mirza Lottullah, that
they may associate with the friends, convey to
them the yearnings of the heart of Abdul-
Baha and explain the degrees oi the powers oi
the Covenant and the importance of the Center
of the Testament. These two persons are very
blessed.
Assuredly the believers shall obtain joy and
happiness through meeting them. Know ye
this, that today the greatest of all affairs is
obedience to the Center of G0d's 
the power of the Covenant shall stir the re-
gions, and the spirit of the Cotrenant shall
res-use-irate.
Therefore, all the believers, in all the meet-
ings and gatherings, must mention the Cove-
nant and raise the song of the Covenant.
Upon ye be 
(Signed) ABBAS.
