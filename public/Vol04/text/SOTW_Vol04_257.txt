The Command of GOD in this Day

ERILY, GOD hath made it incumbent upon
every soul to deliver His Cause [spread The
Message] according to his ability. Thus hath
the Command been recorded by the Finger of
Might and Power upon the Tablet of Majesty and
Greatness.
Whosoever quickens one soul in this Cause is
like unto one quickening all the servants and the
LORD shall bring him forth in the day of resurrec-
tion* into the Rizwan [Paradise] of Qneness adorned
with the Mantle of Himself, the Protector, the Mighty,
the Generous!
Thus will ye assist your LORD, and naught else
save this shall ever be mentioned in this Day before
GOD, your LORD, and the LORD of your fore-
fathers!
--BAHA 
From The Tablet of T/re Branch.
