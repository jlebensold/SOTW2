98 STAR OF THE WEST
may be for this light has no intelligence,
no consciousness.
It is the light of the intellect which
gives us knowledge and understanding
and without this light the physical eyes
would be useless. The light of the in-
tellect is . . . born of the Light divine.
The light of the intellect enables us to
understand and realize all that exists.
But it is the divine Light alone which can
give us sight for the invisible things and
which enables us to see truths that will
not be visible to the world for thousands
of years hence. It was the divine Light
which enabled the prophets to see 2000
years in advance what was going to take
place. And today we see the realization
of their vision. Thus it is this Light
which We must strive to seek, for it is
greater than any other.
By the help of this effulgent Light all
the spiritual interpretation of the holy
writings has been made plain, the hid-
den things of God's universe have be-
come manifest and we have been en-
abled to comprehend the divine purposes
for man.
(Words of Abdul-Baha: Talks Given
in p. 61.)
The light is of four kinds: First, the
light of the sun. . . . Second, the
light of the eye. . . . Third, the light
of the intellect. . . . Fourth, the light
of guidance. This last is the supreme
Light, the conscious reality which coni-
prehends mysteries.
"Can this last ever be cognizable
through the special senses, as the eye?"
Was asked.
"By the insight," Abdul-Baha an-
swered.
('Words of Abdul-Baha: Heavenly
Vista; p. 25.)
Truth (the highest truth) is unattain-
able except through the favor of the
Holy Spirit.
(Abdul-Baha.)
The (Holy) Spirit is encompassing
and surrounding all. It is holy. It is
sanctified from attachment to a special
place. It is present everywhere and at
every time. It exists in all places, yet
is placeless.
("lords of Abdul-Baha: From a. mes-
sage to "Body of Friends" in 1910.)
The Christ is the central point of the
Holy Spirit; he was born of the Holy
Spirit; he was raised up of the Holy
Spirit. . . . The focus of the rays
of the Sun of Reality was Christ; and
from this glorious focus the bounty of
God was reflected upon the other mir-
rors which were the reality of the
apostles. . . . Jesus was the sun and
his rays shone upon his disciples through
his teachings.
(Compiled from the Words of Abdul-
Baha.)
The Holy Spirit (in its completeness)
is given only to the prophets; the peo-
ple can possess but the rays of the Holy
Spirit.
(Abdul-B aha. 
The greatest power of the Holy Spirit
exists in the divine Manifestations of
the Truth the greatest world-
prophets like Christ). Through the
power of the Spirit, the heavenly teach-
ings have been brought into the world
of humanity.
(Words of Abdul-Baha: Talks Given
in Paris; p. 82.)
'When Christ appeared with those
marvelous breaths of the Holy Spirit,
the children of Israel said, "We are
