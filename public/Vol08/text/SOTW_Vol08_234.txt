CHAPTER IX.
Tests
ODAY, Lord, deliver us from
I all temptations, tests and evil sug-
gestions of those who have turned
their faces from thee: Then, thou
merciful God, confirm us through thine
invisible hosts, and reinforce us through
thy heavenly angels.
Lo-rd! We are weak, poor, submis-
sive and humble: Strengthen us, enrich
us and uplift us ab-ove all con-
ditions. thou God! As thou hast
illumined our hearts with the light of
knowing thee, make us firm in thy
blessed Covenant. Verily, thou art the
Clement, the Forgiver!
(Baha'o'llah: Hidden Words; p. 70.)
I am not impatient of calamities in
God 's Way, nor of afflictions for his love
and at his good pleasure. God hath
made affliction as a morning shower to
this green pasture and as a match for
his lamp whereby earth and heaven are
illumined.
(Baha'o'llah; Tablet to (Nassar-ud-Din)
Shah of Persia.)
Behold, happy is the man Whom God
co-rrecteth; therefore despise no-t thou
the chastening of the Almighty: For he
maketh sore, and bindeth up; he Wound-
eth, and his hands make Whole.
(Job 5 :17, 18.)
As many as I love, I rebuke and
chasten: be zealous therefore, and re-
pent.
(Revelation 3 
son of man! If calamity befall
thee not in My path, how Wilt thou tread
in the Way of those who are content in
My Will? If affliction overtake thee not
in thy longing to meet Me, how canst
thou attain the light of the love of My
Beauty." 51.)
son of man! My cala.mity is My
providence. In appearance it is fire and
vengeance; in reality it is .1ight and
mercy. Therefore approach it, that thou
mayest be-come an eternal light and an
immortal spirit. This is My command;
know thou it." 52.)
son of humanity! Rejoice not if
fortune smile upon thee, and if humil-
iation overtake thee, mourn not because
of it, for, in their time, they both shall
cease and be no more." 53.)
son of existence! If thou encounter
poverty, grieve not; for, in time, the
King of riches will descend to thee. Fear
not humiliation, for glory shall be thy
portion." 54.)
son of existence! Be not engrossed
With this World, for with fire We test
the gold, and with gold We try the serv-
ants." 56.)
(Baha'o'llah: Hidden Words from the
Arabic, pp. 15-17.)
The more one is severed from the
World, from desires, from human affairs
and conditions, the more impervious does
one become to- the tests of God. Tests
are a means by which a soul is measured
as to its fitness, and proven out by its
own acts. God knows its fitness before-
hand, and also its unpreparedness, but
man, with an ego, would not believe him-
self unfit unless proof were given him.
Consequently his susceptibility to evil is
proven to him when he falls into the
tests, and the tests are continued until
the soul realizes its own unfitness, then
remorse and regret tend to root out the
Weakness. The same test comes again in
greater degree, until it is shown that a
former Weakness has become a strength,
and the power to overco-me evil has been
established.
