STAR OF THE WEST
ALL the individuals of human-
ity are Farmers. Every soul
sows a certain kind of seed,
but at the season of the harvest
there will be gathered no result,
except from the seeds which are
sown by the believers of God.
That alone will obtain heavenly
blessing. Reflect that His Holiness
Christ and His Holiness Moham-
med scattered such holy seeds the
fruits of which are being gathered
till now; but all the other farmers
were finally doomed to regret and
disappointment.
