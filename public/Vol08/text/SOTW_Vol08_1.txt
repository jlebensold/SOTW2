this age His Holiness Baha'o'llah
I has breathed the Holy Spirit into
the dead body of the world, conse~
quently every Weak soul is strengthened
by theseyfresh Divine out-breathings--
every poor man will become rich, every
darkened soul will become illumined,
every ignorant one will become Wise, be-
cause the confirmations of the Holy
Spirit are descending like torrents. A
new era of Divine consciousness is upon
us. The World of humanity is going
through a process of transformation. A
new race is being developed. The
thoughts of human brotherhood are
permeating all regions. New ideals are
stirring the depths of hearts, and a new
spirit of universal consciousness is be-
ing profoundly felt by all men.
