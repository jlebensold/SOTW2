are indeed glorified by the Supreme Con.-
co-urse, the angels of heaven and the
dwellers in the Kingdom of El-Abha.
But, if the hearts of the people become
void of the divine grace--the love of
wander in the desert of ig-
norance, descend to the depths of ruin
and fall to the abyss of despair where
there is no refuge. They are like in-

with El-Baha.
(Tablets of Vol. 3, p. 325.)
The cause of the creation of the con-
tingent world was love. As it is men-
tioned in the well known tradition
which says, was a hidden treasure
and I wished that I should be known 
so I created the creation that I should
be known;" therefore it is necessary
that all should unite in the religion of
the love of God, in such a way that not
the slightest breeze of difference among
the friends and companions should blow.
All, fixing their gaze upon love, should
move in perfect union so that no differ-
ence among any of them could be ob-
served. In good and evil, in gain and
loss, in adversity and prosperity, all
should partake. . . . .
(Baha 'o 'llah.)
Abdul-Baha said there are five kinds
of love:
First: The love of His own perfec-
tions which caused God to create that
His beauty might be made manifest and
appreciated.
Second: The love between sanctified
souls for the attributes of the divine
which they see reflected in one another.
Third: God's love to man individu-
ally that is gained according to the
measure in which a man turns to God.
Fourth: Ma.n's love for God, the
Creator. This is the cause of his life,
progress and happiness.
Fifth: The love of self, which if
directed to the ego will deprive man of
all true development, but if the love of
self is a realization that one is a crea-
ture of God and must therefore attain
to the station appointed for him, this
love will be an uplifting one.
