created by his own mind. As the finite
cannot comprehend the Infinite so God
is not to be comprehended in this fash-
ion. That which man conceives Wit.h his
own mind he comprehends. That which
he can comprehend is not God. That
conception of God which a man has is
but a phantasm, an image, an imagina-
tion, an illusio-n. There is no connec-
tion between such a conception and the
Supreme Being.
"If a man wishes to know God he
must find him in the perfect mirror,
Christ or Baha'o'llah. In either of these
mirrors he Will see reflected the Sun of
Divinity.
"As We know the physical sun by its
splendor, by its light and heat so We
know God, by the spiritual sun, when
he shines forth from the temple of
Manifestation by his attributes of per-
fection, by the beauty of his qualities
and by the splendor of his light. The
Manifestations of God are the focal cen-
ters of the World . . . .

"The epitome of all worship is the
worship of the attributes of Christ, not
his personality."
(Wiords of Abdul-Baha; a talk given
to Mr. Percy 'Woodcock, Acca, Syria,
1909.)

Turn thy face sincerely toward God;
be severed from all save God; be ablaze
with the fire of the love of God; be
purified and sanctified, and beseech and
supplicate unto God. Verily, he re-
sponds unto those Who invoke him, is
near unto those Who pray unto him.
And he is thy companion in every lone-
l-iness, and befriends every exile.
('Words of Abdul-Ba.ha.; from tablet to
American believer; translated. by Mirza
Ali Kuli Khan, Boston, February, 1908.)
Regarding thy question about the
morning prayer. Both meanings are in-
cluded in the Word dawn--the natural
dawn, and the dawn of the kingdom.
'When a soul rises in the morning from
sleep before everything else he must
commemorate the name of God in order
that he may obtain spirituality and
illumination.
(Words of Abdul-Baha; from tablet to
an American believer; translated by
Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, March 5, 1914,
Mt. Carmel, Haifa.)
Someone present asked how it was
that in prayer and meditation the heart
often turns with instinctive appeal to
some friend who has passed into the next
life.
Abdul-Baha answered: "It is a law
of G0d's creation that the Weak should
lean upon the strong. Those to Whom
you turn may be mediators of God's
power to you, even as when on earth.
But it is the one Holy Spirit which
strengthens all men."
(Words of Abdul-Baha: Abdul-Baha in
London, p. 98.)
Those who have ascended have differ-
ent attributes from those Who are still
on earth, yet there is no real separation.
In prayer there is a mingling of sta-
tion, a mingling of condition. Pray for
them as they pray for you.

London, p. 97 .)

God and assister of all! . . . . .
Verily, thou art the hearer of prayers,
and verily, thou art powerful in all
things! (Abdul-Baha.)
The heavens of thy mercy a11d the
oceans of thy bounty are so vast that
thou hast never disappointed those who
begged of thee nor refused those who
willed to come to thee!
