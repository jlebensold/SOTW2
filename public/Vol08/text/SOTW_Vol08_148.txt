148 STAR-OF THE WEST
Letter by the President of the Bahai Temple Unity
"Ba.ha'o'llah came to breathe life
into the dead body of the world."
Dear friends in E1-Abha:
This Peerless Century for which all
centuries have existed, in which all the
horizons of the world have- been il-
lumined and which encircles the World of
man with the glory of God, completes
the span of its centennial Nov. 12th, the
Hundredth Anniversary of the birth of
Baha 'o 'llah.
This age, the meeting point of the
eternal past with the eternal future, has
opened the attraction of earth to the
hosts of heaven longing to follow in His
Visitation; and to the hosts of earth has
opened the doors of Heaven to walk
with the Center of His Covenant. How
great is the bounty that we are privi-
leged to live in this radiant day, this
age of bestowals!
"Now what will our endeavors
show forth from the degrees of de-
votion?"
In a World torn with dissension and
rent with division the Bahai body must
be the dayspring of composure, the
organism of unity sustaining the breath
of the Holy Spirit.
"It is not your work but that of
the Holy Spirit which you breathe
forth through the Word. This is a
fundamental truth; when you
breathe forth the breath of the Holy
Spirit from your hearts into the
world, commerce and politics will
take care of themselves in perfect
harmony. All arts and sciences will
become revealed and the knowledge
of God will be manifested."
Abdul-Baha.
The mystery of unity consists in spir-
itually breathing together, that the ar-
teries of the world may be purified by
the respiration of heaven. In all the
Assemblages gathered together on Nov.
12th lovingly to commemorate with joy
and glad tidings the birth of Baha'o 'l1ah,
individually and in Assembly, let us
supplicate the Lordly Oneness to bestow
upon His servants, as an organic body,
the breath of the Holy Spirit to unite us
and show forth to mankind the fruits
of unity, for this breath of oneness is the
attribute of God in the world of His
humanity.
Thereby will we show forth the de-
grees of devotion.
The Chicago Convention of 1916
pledged for itself and the Bahais of
America to have subscribed by this An-
niversary date of Nov. _12th, the initial
fund indicated by Abdul-Baha for the
conception of the foundation of the
Mashrak-el-Azkar.
Each feels the share of his responsibil-
ity. This accomplishment will bring new -era in this Cen-
tury of Light. Can we make this blessed
commemoration the fulfillment of our
heart's desire, the Temple fund to start
the Temple, that the spiritual and mate-
rial foundations may meet"?
Thus will we show forth the degrees of
our endeavor.
"Verily the founding of the
Mashrak-el-Azkar will mark the
inception of the Kingdom of God
on earth." Abdul-Baha.
The hand of Power has placed in our
hands this kingly service.
The Executive Board sends to you its
greetings, and joins with you in loving
commemoration, that this meeting of
Nov. 12th may fulfill the aspirations of
our hopes.
Executive Board,
BAHAI TEMPLE UNITY.
William H. Randall, President.
