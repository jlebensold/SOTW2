IN this age, hasl breathed the Holy Spirit
into the dead body of the world. Consequently, every
Weak soul is strengthened by those divine outbreathings.
Every poor man, will become rich, every darkened soul will
become illumined, every ignorant one will become wise, because
the confirmations of the Holy Spirit are descending like unto
torrents. A new era of divine consciousness is upon us. The
world of humanity is going through a process of transformation.
A new race is being developed. The thoughts of human
brotherhood are permeating the depths of hearts and a new
spirit of universal consciousness is being profoundly felt by
all men.
