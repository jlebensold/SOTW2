 The Divine Springtime
ye beloved of God! When the
Winds blow severely, rains fall fiercely,
the lightning flashes, the thunder roars,
the bolt descends and storms of trial
become severe, grieve not; for after this
storm, verily the divine spring will ar-
rive, the hills and fields will become ver-
dant, the expanses of grain will joy-
fully wave, the earth will become cov-
ered with blossoms, the trees will be
clothed with green garments and
adorned with blossoms and fruits.
Thus blessings become manifest in all
countries. These favors are results of
those storms and hurricanes.
The discerning man rejoiceth at the
day of trials, his breast becometh di-
lated at the time of severe storms, his
eyes become brightened when seeing the
showers of rain and gusts of wind,
whereby trees are Liprooted; because he
foreseeth the result and the end (of these
trials), the leaves, blossoms and fruits
(which follow this wintry storm);
while the ignorant (short-sighted) per-
son becometh troubled when he seeth a
storm, is saddened when it raineth se-
verely, is terrified oy the thunder and
trembleth at the surging of the waves
which storm the shores.
ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
