thou Star of the West! HE Is 
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long, thou shalt
become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper _of the
Bahais which is orga.nized"in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are limited,
thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakable, become the object of the attentlon
of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the Covenant. an the
future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto the waves of the sea; thy volume increase,
thy arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fume will be raised and become world-wide--and at
last thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humamty. 'yet all these depend upon firmness, firmness,
firmness! (Signed) Armor.-Bun. ABHAS.

we see your hi-ngs and Til-l67"8 laolslz-wing
their treasures more freely on means for
the dests-uction of the ha-l--man race than
on that which would conduce to the hap-
piness of monk/l-nd. These and
this bloodshed and discord must cease,
and all men he as one kindred and one
family.
"Let not a man glory in this that he
looes his coimlry; let him rather glory
in this that he loves his hi-nd."
The Words that follow, with all their
oriental iinagcry, can hardly be con-
ceived today as words Whose utterance
would throw a man into prison or keep
him there, if already confined. They
are the Words of Baha.'o'lla.h.
"Be thou a- gi-veer, when thou. art
wealth-J, and grateful, when thou art
poor.
