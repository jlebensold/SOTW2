STAR OF THE WEST 351
MIRZA HAJI NIAZ
This servant of God and of Abdul-
Baha passed peacefully into the King-
dom of the Supreme One, Dec. 5, 1919,
at Cairo, Egypt, after 3. brief illness.
Born in Persia, an early follower of
to whom his whole life
was devoted in loyal service. In his
younger days he traveled quite exten-
sively. His great love and devotion to
the Center of the Covenant made him a
joyful servant in this Glorious Cause.
Though he lived to be a very old man,
so old that no one knew his exact age,
yet he kept strong and vigorous in body.
This state of health, with his wonder-
ful faith and love for the Bahai Move-
ment and its followers, kept him young
in spirit, always cheerful and smiling,
that it was ever a great pleasure for
the friends to meet him, and the younger
Bahais were much attracted to him. He
had lived in Cairo many years, and
always he Was in his accustomed place
at the weekly Bahai Assembly. It was
ever such a joy for me to meet him
there, with his kindly grasp of the hand,
and cheery words of welcome. He had
seen all of the American believers who
had ever been to Cairo, and he always
remembered them all most afiectionately,
frequently inquiring of me of the diifer-
ent ones by name whom he had seen,
and Wishing me to send them his loving
greetings whenever I wrote. You will
all remember him who have seen him, as
he was the oldest Bahai here, with a long
White beard, and Wearing a White tur-
ban, so that he approached in appear-
ance the nearest of anyone to Abdul-
Baha. We all shall greatly miss him.
But we have loving memories of him,
still feel his spiritual presence here with
us, and rejoice with him upon his joy-
ful entrance into the glorious Kingdom
of God. Elinor Hisooas.
