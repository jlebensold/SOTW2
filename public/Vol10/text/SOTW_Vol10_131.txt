STAR OF THE WEST 131
"Strive ye in the promulgation oi this growing magazine
only for service to the Cause of God."
RECENT TABLET TO THE BAHAIS OF PERSIA
To the members of tl1e Spiritual Com-
mittee, Teheran--Upon them be BAHA-
El-Abhal
[Ia is God!
0 friends of God!
The magazine of the STAR or THE
Wnsr, notwithstanding great difficulties
during the days of the war, has con-
tinued until these days of quietness and
tranquillity which have come. Although
it had been cut off entirely from Persia,
yet it managed to exist itself. Therefore
financial hardships obtained.
But now that War has ended in peace,
there must be given regularity to the
STAR or THE \VEs'r, so that it may cir-
culate throughout the East and the
VVest. And this is conditioned upon the
increase in number of the subscribers.
Therefore, the friends in all the prov-
inces of Persia must subscribe to this
blessed matter. Strive ye in the pro-
mulgation of this growing magazine only
for service to the Cause of God, in order
that it may become the means of the
stimulation of its editors and for the best
regularity of the institution.
Likewise, if possible, some of the
friends may subscribe to the newspaper
Chehreh Nema in Egypt and pay the
subscriptions in advance.
Upon ye be El-Baha-el-Abha!
