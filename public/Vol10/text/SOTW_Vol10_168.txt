Outline of how Supplication was drafted
BY ~Cl-urn
The greatest difiiculty and hardship
endured by the Bahais of America dur-
ing the great War Was their deprivation
of means of communication With their
beloved, Abdul-Baha. Notwithstanding
the keen realization" by the firm believers
of his spiritual presence in our midst
to guide and protect, this. physical>> cut-
ting off was a really terrible experience
in the Work of the Cause, so that when
the first Wonderful reports about His
Excellency came to us~--the Word cabled
by the British Government to the Em-
bassy here in America, telling' us of
him,--it was as though' all clouds of
trouble were rolling away and the
warmth of the sunlight was again quick~
ening our poor bodies. One heard im-
mediately on all sides the hope expressed
that We might once again be blessed by his
SCHEFFLER
holy presence in our midst. At the Feast
held October 16, 1918, at the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Leo Perron, Chicago, this hope
expressed itself in actio11. It was de-
cided to Write a supplication to Abdul-
Baha asking him tocome, and at the
next meeting of the House of Spiritu-
ality the members suggested that all of
the friends in the country surely would
join us in this great matter, and the
secretary was instructed to address all
the assemblies a11d lay the matter before
them. The supplication was drafted by
Miss Jean Masson, assisted by a com-
mittee from the House. All of the sig-
natures Were 11ot received until several
weeks had passed, so that in the early
part of January the Whole document was
sent to Acca.
