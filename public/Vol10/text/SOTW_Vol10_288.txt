Z88 STAR OF
words written on the heart of a true
believer by the finger of God.
0h, the sacrifice that is needed! Oh,
the cutting loose from all things! Oh,
the self-abnegation that you and I must
practice! Oh, the torture of the wounds
that we must endure, laughing and joy-
fully! Oh, the prayers that we must
pray that at the very moment of triumph
we may not yield to the Satan and glory
in self, to the awful serpent that is al-
ways in our garden presenting to us
the Wonderful feast of the flower of
self-indulgence in some Way or other!
God grant that we may endure, and God
grant that we may ask for calamities and
sacrifice so that we may get away from
that thing, because in that Way alone
can you and I manifest divinity through
inspiration.
'What is inspiration? What is the
manifestation of divinity through in-
spiration? I tell you, the finger of
God will not Write a great ill
the mirror that is dulled with the
ashes of self. The light Will not shine
powerfully through that mirror. In-
spired words are not horn forth from
such a mouth, and when in the mercy
of God everything has been taken away,
and we are only left the power to testify
to His glory--and perhaps nothing else
-then will our souls glory in that We
have been given the power for His sake
to endure, that this thing might happen.
Oh, brothers and sisters of the Cause,
seek, seek, seek, for eternal happiness in
that way! Don't rest a moment and
don't forever be asking that your self-
satisfaction may be gratified, that you
may be put up or put down in some place
you may like, but that you may en-
dure, that you may receive. Because all
sacrifices, the sacrifices that these blessed
Ones, these glorious Ones, come and
make are the greatest of all. What they
have endured! Why? Let me mention
one thing which is in keeping with our
subject. You and I collectively have
the power to make of Abdul-Baha the
false Christ, we have that power when
THE WEST
you and I do not let him Write on our
hearts and speak through our lips of
his power a.nd testify from whence he
comes. But as you and I prove faithful
to the truth, as we receive in our hearts
the glory of this power, and as We,
through faithfulness, on the mount of
faithfulness dwell, so will We testify that
he is no false Christ, but in our lives
prove him to be the return of the Son
of God upon earththat divine manifestation through
inspiration. "How great, the greatest
sacrifice that ere was made for man,
when from the heavenly radiant throne
the light descends to our dark 
God 's perfect plan!"
Again and yet again hath shone
That ray divine, supreme,
God's lowly Messengers have come,
Have sacrificed and have proclaimed
The mighty theme.
It mirrored forth through our Lord
Christ
Who left for us this prayer
To pray, that God's blest day would
come
When all would be fulfilled, and Love
Reign everywhere.
Now, is the sacrifice complete!
God doth His day enthrone!
The Lamb of God, Abdul-Baha,
Hath come! He is our King of Love
And we, his own.
Come forth! from every land appear!
In him are all things well.
Awake! and leave behind aught else
Ye sons of God; He's calling you
'With him to 
New glories on new glories 
do not hesitate!
The mystery of love is ours
And for our sake hath come this high,
This vast estate.
