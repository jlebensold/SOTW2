is God!
thou firm in the Covenant!
Your last letter dated October 28,
1918, was received. Its contents caused
joy and gladness for they indicated the
firmness and steadfastness of the friends
in the Cause of God.
Praise be to God, the gloomy clouds
of war have been partly dissipated from
the horizon of the World. The hope is
entertained that gradually they will ut-
terly vanish and rest and comfort will
be established. Grasp therefore the
present opportunity, for a wonderful
capacity for the hearing of divine teach-
ings has been manifested among men.
Concentrate, therefore, at present your
Whole efiort in spreading the Message.
It is time for the diifusion of fragrances
and the promulgation of divine teach-
ings and for nothing more. The World
of humanity is athirst and these divine
teachings are pure. and limpid water.
Exert efiort in teaching and if blessed
souls undertake to travel through all
the states of America, complete and
thorough confirmations from the King-
dom of Abha shall be witnessed by
them, so much so that they shall be
bewildered. Verily, this is an exceed-
ingly momentous question.
You had inquired about the de-
spatched and unsigned letter. That let-
ter is authentic and its original copy is
safely kept and signed. 'Whenever an
unsigned letter arrives, inquire before
putting it into action and wait until an
answer is given.
Convey respectful greeting to all the
friends. The question of the Mashre-
kol-Azkar is of great. importance. The
friends accordingly must exert a great
deal of eifort and must be self-sacrificing
so that its construction may begin.
As to appeal and encouragement for
the Mashrekol-Azkar, in view of the
glory and eminence of the Cause, it must
be made orally or through private per-
sonal letters.
Your children who indeed are mine,
embrace each of them and show them on
my behalf utmost kindness and amiabil-
ity.
Upon thee be El-Abba!

EDNA TRUE

El-Abha!
He Is God!
thou respected one!
Your letter dated February 2-nd, 1919,
has been received, and thy service to
the world of humanity, during these
days of terrible War, acceptable at the
Kingdom of God. Verily, thou hast
magnificently engaged in service; hast
given up thy rest and comfort in Amer-
ica and hast hastened to Europe so that
thou mayest be of service to the world
of humanity.
Praise thou God for having been
therein assisted. At present continue
these services until the end in the same
department and whenever it has been
made possible for thee to undertake a
trip to the Holy Land in the utmost
joy and fragrance, thou art permitted
to present thyself.
Convey in writing to thy respected
mother greeting on my behalf.
Upon thee be El-Baha-el-Abha!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
