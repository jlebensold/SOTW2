STAR OF THE WEST 75
Praise be to the One who made them
the signs of glad tidings among the
people!
Praise be to the One who confirmed
them by the banners of the great
signs!
Praise be to the One who re-inforced
them by the mighty forces!
Praise be to the One who assisted them
with the hosts from the Supreme Con-
course!
Praise be to the One who built for them
lofty palaces commanding the zeniths
of heaven from which the lights
sparkle throughout the centuries and
the ages!
Then, ye Who are attracted by the
fragrances of God, thank ye God for
this complete bounty, infinite mercy, en-
circling outpouring and perfect attain-
ment! I pray God to strengthen your
loins, give power to your backs, clarify
your secrets and purify your consciences
in all times and moments.
Upon ye be greetings and praise!
