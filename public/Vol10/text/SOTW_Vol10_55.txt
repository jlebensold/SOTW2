crowded at each of the sessions of the
Congress, nine in number, while the

The fact that while we were gathered,
discussing plans for spiritual union and
harmony throughout the world, the del-
egates at Paris, in the Peace Conference,
Were meeting to establish the new world
ically portrayed by and
emphasized by Abdul-Baha, would come
to such_ a rapid culmination! It is

in the metropolis of the new world.
Since the last Convention, the thunder of
the cannon and the rattle of musketry
had been stilled, and the na.tions of the
world, under the terms of the armistice,
await the verdict of their representa-
tives, gathered in solemn conclave. 
would have dreamed, ten years ago,
when the First Bahai Temple Unity
Convention was held in Chicago, that

nationalism and world unity, strange to
their minds and tongues, but familiar to
the Bahais.
A striking feature of the Feast of
Rizwan was the presence and participa-
tion of several clergymen and leaders in
other broad lines of thought,--chiefly
