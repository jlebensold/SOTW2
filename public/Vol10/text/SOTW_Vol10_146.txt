TODAY, all the peoples of the world are in-
dulging in self-interest and exert the ut-
most effort and endeavor to promote their
own material interests. They are worshipping
themselves and not the Divine Reality nor the
world of mankind. They seek diligently their
own benefit and not the common weal. This is
because they are captives of the world of
nature and unaware of the divine teachings,
of the bounty of the Kingdom and of the Sun
of Truth. But ye, praise be to God, are at
present especially favored with this bounty,
have become of the chosen, have been in~
formed of the heavenly instructions, have
gained admittance into the Kingdom of God,
have become the recipients of unbounded bless-
ings, and have been baptized with the Water
of Life, with the fire of the Love of God and
with the Holy Spirit.
