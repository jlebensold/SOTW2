even the strangers maysubscribe to it. Articles must be published, dealing with the uni-
versal principles of the Cause, the writers proving that this Cause takes a vital interest in
all the social and religious movements of the age and is conducive to the progress of the
world and its inhabitants. In short, the STAR or THE WEST must promote the aspirations and

return of Dr. Zia M. Bagdadi to the Holy Land and the traveling of
Mirza Ahmad Sohrab throughout the Western States of the United States of America,
has temporarily made it impossible for us to publish the Persian section. We trust it
will soon reappear, and that our Persian friends will be patient with us until then.
