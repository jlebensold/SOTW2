These are the Teachings which are the Spirit of this

RECENT TABLET TO THE PARIS ASSEMBLY
To the friends of God and the maid-
servants of tl1e Merciful One, in Paris,
them be the Glory of
God El-Abha!
He Is God!
friends of God!
Your letter was received through Mrs.
Stannard. Its contents gave me the
utmost joy, be to God 
the Spiritual Meeting has been organ-
ized also in Paris. Confirmed believers
come together and engage in speaking
of the Kingdom of God, in seeking the
Truth, and in speaking the teachings
which are the spirit of this age;
The unity of mankind.
The establishment of universal peace,
right and justice.
Showing that religion must be con-
ducive to harmony amongst men,
and conforming to reason and
science.
The equality of men and women.
Freedom and liberty for all.
The enlightenment of heavenly mor-
als.
Love for all men and even for animals.
The universalization of general knowl-
edge.
A profession, trade, agriculture', are
worshiping God. A farmer who
cultivates his land with the utmost
application is like a worshiper who,
with deepest reverence and humil-
ity, prays to God in a temple.
When the laborer works honestly
and sincerely it is as though he
were praying.
These are the teachings which are the
spirit of this century and the light of
this age. Whoever inhales their fragrance
is drawn to them, especially as they are
confirmed by the Testament and the
Covenant, the Covenant which is the
cause of illuminating the world, which
gives the Spirit of Life, makes souls en-
lightened, divine and celestial, causes
them to shine like a light and trans-
forms them into scintillating stars.
friends of Paris! Know that no
soul is quickened except through the
spirit of the Covenant, no is illum-
ined except by the light of the Coven-
ant, no ear is thrilled except by the mel-
ody of the Covenant, and no heart shows
forth the divine sentiments except by the
bounty of the Covenant. The people
of Paris are full of enthusiasm and be-
come attracted with the utmost swift-
ness. Therefore, the fire of the love of
God will burn intensely and spread
everywhere.
Some of the regions of Europe are ex-
tremely enthusiastic. Day by day more
souls enter the Cause. You have heard
of this certainty. Now, make an ef-
fort, and with all your might enkindle
the fire of love of the Covenant, so that
Paris may surpass the other regions and
if the Covenant is made to shine forth as
it should, in a short time wonderful re-
sults will become apparent; for, in this
day, the moving power throughout the
whole world is the power of the Coven-
ant: it is the artery pulsating in the
body of the phenomenal.
To sum up, I am greatly pleased with
these few souls who are in Paris, and I
love you very much. I hope that you
will fill the meeting with enthusiasm,
and be the cause of guidance to others.
Convey greetings on my behalf to each
one, and upon you be greetings and
praises.
