STAR OF THE WEST
TheCall
(Continued from page SO)
Eastern land! Vast China and Japan!
Thy pride returneth, as of ancient man!
Thy Great Redeemer standeth at the door,
His heralds hasten--joy forevermore!
eager World, Thy waited Lord is here!
Fill hearts With hope, abandon every fear.
Forgotten hate, let love reign all-supreme.
And lo accomplished is the Golden Dream!
ye Who know, the Master calleth ye
To rise and serve, that all the world be free!
As millions rose, a few brief moons 
To offer life to vanquish threat 'ning foe-
S0 shalt ye rally to the Heavenly King,
And life and all to His Cause gladly bring;
Content and happy if it be to die
Or live in exile if but He be nigh.
Count not the cost, ye Army of our God,
Thine is the noblest field man ever trod.
Thy victory is certain as the sun,
Thy fame eternal when the conflict is 
Heav'nly world! The Kingdom soon to be,
Where God shall reign o'er all, from sea to sea;
Where men of every race shall do His Will,
And love of everyman each heart shall fill.
Lordly host, Abdul-Baha commands!
Advance ye, conquer near and distant lands.
"Allah 'o 'Abha!" is the battle-cry--
Eternal life to those who else must die!
The great new charters of the World are read!
The Word hath spoken--noW thy feet must tread,
From north to south, from east to west, the world
Till far and near His banner is unfurled!
Washington, D. C., April 21, 1919.
