74- STAR OF THE WEST
Praise be to the One who perfumed the
nostrils of the people of oneness with
the merciful fragrance which is dif-
fused in all the countries! "And
thou didst see that the land which Was
barren and lifeless when We caused
the Water to descend upon it, moved
and grew and brought forth a beauti-
ful pair of all things."
Praise be to the One through the out-
pouring of Whose clouds these coun-
tries became verdant!
Praise be to the One through the heavy
rain of Whose compassion these rose
gardens became beautified!

Praise be to the one through the current
of Whose stream, these reservoirs be-
came overflowing!
Praise be to the One who has chosen
the sincere ones to spread His teach-
ings in the countries!
Praise be to the One who selected for
His mercy pure souls; through the fra-
grance of Whose love and perfumed
breaths the hearts of the pious throb!
Praise be to the One who made the stars
of guidance to smite the Wicked!
Praise be to the One who guided the
chosen community to the upright Way
and straight path!
