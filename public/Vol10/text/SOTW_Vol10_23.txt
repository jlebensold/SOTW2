Words of the Beloved of our life.
Let us all meanwhile pray day and

intoxicated with this new wine which
Abdul-Balia has prepared for us and

demonstrate whether We can rise to the
heights of this golden opportunity;

Hoping that we Will all meet in that
sacred Convention, receive the baptism
of the Holy Spirit and go forth into the
World with a new power, a new vision,
a new strength, and dedicate anew at
the Convention our service to the World
of humanity through the divine teach-
ings of the Center of the Covenant.
Your sincere brother in the Cause,
Ahanod.
