Covenant, we sailed from Italy; and on

presence of Abdul-Baha. He inquired
about all the friends in America and he
is pleased with all.
Oh! what a difference between now

there was only injustice. Now, for the

LETTER FROM GEORGE LATIMER
On board S. Comopio.
December 19, 1919.
To the STAR or THE Wusrz
After twelve wonderful days at Haifa,
on the "Mountain of God" with Abdul-
Baha, our boat arrived three days ahead
of time to bring us back to America.
At first the news of its sudden arrival
saddened us, but we soon realized that
our cup of capacity had already been
filled to the brim and our greatest joy
was to carry back the love and fra-

in America.
Now that all the doors of communica-
tion have been opened, Abdul-Baha. is
extremely busy welcoming the 'pilgrims
from all parts of the world and sending

activity was an inspiration to us all, and
his supreme joy is the news of unity and
the progress of the Cause.
