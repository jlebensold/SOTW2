STAR OF THE WEST
Mrs. Mary O. Byron Clarke read the
address delivered by Abdul-Baha. on Mt.
Carmel, in 1910, at the annual celebra-
tion of the Bab 's declaration in which
the Covenant proclaimed that "the com>>
memoration and celebration of this meet~
ing shall remain and be duly observed
forever throughout endless ages; it is
under the merciful glances of the Blessed
Beauty."
The Story of the declara~
tion, his teachings, his life and martyr-
dom, his eloquently present-
ed by Dr. Zia M. Bagdadi, a participant
in b-ringing the body of the great Herald
of the Manifestation to Haifa in 190-9,
and delivering it into the safe keeping
of Abdul-Baha. An impressive story,
which never fails, and should be re-
corded With great accuracy of detail for
reference by future generations.
A brief greeting by Mrs. Mary Ha11~
ford Ford and the singing of the Bene~
diction closed the Chicago celebration
of the centenary of the Bab.
