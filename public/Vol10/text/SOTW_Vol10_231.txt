KOKAB MAG CUTCHEON
To the maid-servant of God, Kokab Mac-
Cutcheon, Minneapolis, Minnesota-
Upon her be E1-Aloha!
He Is God!
thou brilliant Kokab (Star) 1
Praise be to God! Thou hast become
resplendent with the light of guidance
and from the bestowals of the Kingdom
of God thou hast partaken a share and
a portion. In tests thou hast remained
firm and upright.
At present thy purpose is to organize
a meeting and to guide the souls in the
divine Kingdom. Excellent is thy in-
tention. Found thou this assembly in
thy own home and arise in the guidance
of souls.
Be thou not grieved on account of the
departure of thy father, mother and
brother because they became delivered
from the World which is full of sadness
and sorrow and they have hastened to
the realm of joy. They have become
freed from the fetters of this prison and
soared to the divine court.
Thou hast asked for permission to
come. At present your presence there
is necessary, so that the Cause may be
established. After the establishment of
the Cause thou hast permission to come.
Should it be possible for thee to es-
tablish a school for the Bahai children
and teach, it will he exceedingly accept-
able.
Upon thee be El-Baha-el-Abha!

CORA DITMARS
To the maid-servant of God, Cora Dit-
mars, Spokane, lVashington--Upon
her be E-1-Abhal
He I God!
thou who art firm in the Covenant?
Thy letter was received. Thou hast
exerted a great effort for that im-
prisoned person. Perhaps it may prove
to be fruitful. Tell him, however, that
the denizens of the World are confined
in the prison oi nat-ure--~a prison that
is continuous and eternal. If thou art
at present restrained within the limits
of a temporary prison, be not grieved
at this; my hope is that thou inayest be
emancipated from the prison of nature
and may attain unto the court of ever-
lasting Life. Pray to God day and
night and beg forgiveness and pardon.
The omnipotence of God shall solve
every difficulty.
thou dear maid-servant of God!
Praise be to God, thou art endowed with
a pure heart and an exalted determina-
tion. Thou hast an eloquent tongue
and givest to every person a share and
portion of the teachings of God.
Abdul-Baha does not seek membersliip
at the Peace Congress. He promul-
gates peace through the power of the
Word of God. It is impossible to estab-
lish universal peace save through this
power.
Convey on my behalf to those souls
whose names thou hast mentioned in
thy letter, greeting and kindness. I
pray God that they may be confirmed in
service to the Kingdom of God.
It is preferable that in the meetings,
one of the attendants should read or
chant the Tablets of His Holiness
and the others listen to
the reading.
Upon thee be Baha-El-Abhal
