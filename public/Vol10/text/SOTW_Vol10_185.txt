STAR OF THE WEST 185
As to thy new business, the former
trade. . . . is the cause of thy comfort.
The new business will engage greatly
your mind. It is advisable for thee to
engage in the previous trade and devote
the rest of your time to spiritual mat-
ters.
Upon thee be Baha-el-Abha!

DR. OLIVE G. COUCH
To her honor, Dr. Olive G. Couch, New
York City--Upon her be 
El-Abhal
He Is God 
thou attracted to the Kingdom of God I
Thy letter dated January 31st, 1919,
was received. Although I am bodily
far and remote, yet in spirit I associate
and am intimate with you. Do not be
grieved. Divine beatitude is thy pos-
session and divine glad-tidings abide
with thee. This bliss and gladuess is
not followed by grief and this illumina-
tion leaves no room for darkness.
At present engage in service to the
Kingdom of God. Whenever the ways
will be opened and the means will be
fully provided by which thou mayest
travel in perfect comfort and ease then
thou hast permission to present thyself.
Convey my greeting to Mrs. Beede.
It was a long time that the (holy)
leaves were awaiting the receipt of her
news, but so far no letter has been re-
ceived from her. But now that you
have informed us of her news the whole
family has been made grateful.
Upon thee be greeting and praise

WILL LEVINGTON COMFORT.
To his honor Will Levington Comfort,
through Shahnaz Waite--Upon him
be Baha-El-Abha!
He Is God!
thou son of the Kingdom!
Praise be to God, that like unto a
torch thou hast been ignited, and like
unto a star thou hast shone. This light
is the light of reality, which is divine
guidance, and not a material one. It is
a heavenly lamp and not an 
one which, although it reveals objects,
yet it does not discover and comprehend
them, i. it is unaware of the world of
things, and simply reveals them to the
eye; while on the other hand, the light
of Truth both reveals and discovers ob-
jects and does moreover comprehend
them.
Praise be to God that thou hast at-
tained to such alight.
Upon thee be Baha-el-Abha!

SHANAZ KHANUM.
To the maid-servant of God, Shanaz
Khanum, Los Angeles, California--
Upon her be El-Abha!
Is God!
thou revered maid-servant of God!
Thy letter from Los Angeles was re-
ceived. Thank divine Providence that
thou hast been assisted in service and
hast been the cause of the promulgation
of the oneness of the world of human-
ity.
Not until the darkness of differences
among men is dissipated with the pavil-
ion of unity cast its shadow over all re-

peace and universal reconciliation are
unachievable. 'This illumined age ne-
cessitates its fulfillment.
Every century has its own ideal which,
in accord with that century, is confirm-
ed. In this illumined era, that which is
