STAR OF THE WEST 63
Christian religion has been divided as
though they were the stops and pedals
of some great organ, some emphasizing
the essential notes, others stressing the
merely ornamental notes, but no one of
itself giving forth the full-orbed music,
but the harmonious blending of the in-
dividual melodies producing the sym-
phony of universal aspiration and faith.
That same spirit of appreciation causes
you to recognize the fact that differ-
ences of climate, of racial origin, dif-
ferences of environment, have given rise
to varying expressions of one and the
same spiritual sentiments, wonder, awe,
reverence, aspiration, worship; so that
whether it be the Aztec, bowing before
his feathered god, or whether it be the
New Zealander, bowing before his shape-
less block; or whether it be the Moham-
medan, prostrate in front of his mosque;
or, again, the Christian, praying to his
Father in heaven; or whether it be the
cosmic theist, communing with "the in-
finite and eternal Energy," it is every-
where one and the same spiritual hun-
ger, one and the same manifestation of
passion to make progress in the upper
zones of his being that is disclosed.
And then, perhaps, as a further
ground for the powerful appeal that
your Movement has made to me, I would
mention the emphasis that you lay so
persistently upon unity,--the master-
word of the hour. And if I may dare
to say as the first Hague
Conference foreshadowed the coming of
a successful League of Nations, so the
World 's Parliament of Religions, at Chi-
cago, foreshadowed the coming fulfill-
ment of the Bahai dream. Of that
dream of religious fellowship I can say
only that in my judgment it is nothing
less than sublime, for its horizon ex-
pands far beyond any sectarian boun-
daries.
Just now we are witnessing a most
interesting experiment fathered by our
friends of the Episcopal Church,--a
"World-Conference on faith and or-
der," the preparations for which I have
been following very closely for the past
nine years. It may be that the imme-
diate purpose of that world-conference
will fall short of its sublime ambition,
but whether it falls short of it or not,
that conference is destined to produce
a marked increase of mutual tolerance,
mutual charity, mutual understanding
and mutual teachableness. As such, it
is certain to mark one forward step
toward that larger unity that cannot be

embraced by even the Word "Chris-
tian." For, I take it, friends, that it is
not enough for us to be brothers and
sisters in Christ, or in Moses, or in the
Buddha, or in Zoroaster; we must be
brothers and sisters in Humanity, with
all the rest of mankind. I trust you will
not misunderstand me. I will be second
to no man in my reverence and admira-
tion for the person and life of Jesus,
but Christian exclusiveness is no more
warranted than any other. And, if hu-
man brotherhood is ever going to be
anything other than the grim caricature
that we see today, with the rival relig-
