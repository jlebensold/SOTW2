HE IS 
THE Supreme Pen says: friends of the
Truth! The purpose of bearing these con-
tinuous sufferings and uninterrupted calamities
is, that the souls who are assured in God may,
with utmost unity, associate with one another to
such an extent that discord and difference be-
tween two individuals may vanish from them,
except in special ordinances revealed in the di-
vine Books. The man with innersight does not
see imperfection in any condition. Whatsoever
happens is a proof of the greatness of his con-
dition and of the purity of his entity. For ex-
ample, if a soul becomes humble, indeed this
humbleness to the friends of God returns to
God, for they look at his faith. By God! In
