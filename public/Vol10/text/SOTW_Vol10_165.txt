To Dr. Zia M. Bagdadi, Chicago,
Dear brother:
. . . . A general Tablet, remark-
able and detailed, has been revealed for
the friends and maid-servants of God
throughout the United States and Can-
ada. It has been dispatched. I am
enclosing the supplication of over 1000
American friends. Their names have
been sent with the Tablet. Ab-
dul-Baha ordered me to Write to you
concerning this important, momentous
question. Publish in the Persian and
English columns of the STAR or THE
\VEs'r the Persian and English texts of
the enclosed supplication. Then publish

all the names one by one and after that
publish the general Tablet in Persian as
well  in English, all in the same copy
of the STAR, no matter how voluminous
it may become. Then send at least a
couple of copies to every province in
Persia, addressed to Bahai Assemblies
orindividuals. Also send at least one
copy of the convention photo to each
province of Persia, that all Persian
Bahais may see what miracles have been
Wrought, what acliievenaents have been
made, wh at victories have been Won, what
a universal, a simultaneous response to
the trumpet call of service has talten
hold of the western friends. This is the
Beloved's command, fulfill it. . . .
Ever yours afiieotionately,
S'7z0g71.i.
