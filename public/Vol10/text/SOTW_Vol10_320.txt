in the divine orchard, become -a fruitful
tree, may cast an extensive shade and
may extend their branches and leaves
to the divine Kingdom. I pray God
that both may be illumined, assisted
and confirmed.
Upon thee be Baha-El-Abha!

EMILY OLSEN
To the maid-servant of God, Emily
Olsen, Chicago, Illinois-Upon her
be E1-Abha!
He Is God!
thou pure leaf of the Blessed Tree!
Thy letter was received. Thou hast
Written thou hadst translated some
epistles and Tablets into Danish and
sent them to Europe during the war.
So far nothing has been heard of them.
As war was going on, answer from Eu-
rope was delayed. But now as War
has given way to peace it is hoped that
the translation of these Tablets and
epistles may be disseminated through-
out Denmark.
As to the teachings thou hast ar-
ranged for children, God willing, they
will be enforced.
Upon thee be Baha-El-Abha!

JAMES MORTON
To his honor, Mr. James Morton, New
York Oity, N. him be
Baha-El-Abha 1
He Is God!
thou dignified personage!
Thy letter was received. Its terms
were most eloquent and its signific.ances
in the utmost perfection. Praise be to
God, thou hast harkened to the call of
the Kingdom, hast secured a, share and
portion of the divine teachings, hast
been freed from the world of imitations,
hast investigated Truth and hast com-
prehended the mysteries of heavenly
books. At present thy wish is to become
the cause of the illumination of the
world of mankind, to promulgate the
principle of universal peace, to awake
the slumbering and to cause the heedless
to become heedful so that they may be
freed from ignorant prejudices, may se-
cure rest and comfort under the shade
of the pavilion of the oneness of man-
kind, may partake of divine bestowals
and may become the center of merciful
susceptibilities. There is no purpose
higher than this. My hope is that thou
mayest be confirmed therein.
Thou art thinking of traveling to
Persia. The project is a blessed one.
I hope that after visiting the Holy Land
thou mayest be confirmed in that voy-
age.
Upon thee be Baha~El-Abha!
