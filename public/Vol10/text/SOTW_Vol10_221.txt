them be El-Abba!
He Is God!
my dear children!
Your letter Was received. A degree
of joy was attained that is beyond oral
as Well as Written expression that,
praise be to God, the power of the
Kingdom of God has trained such chil-
dren Who from their early childhood
eagerly Wish to acquire a Bahai educa-
tion that they may from the period of
their childhood engage in service to the
world of humanity.
My highest wish and desire is that ye
who are my children may be educated
according to the teachings of His Holi-
ness and may receive a
Bahai training; that ye may each become
an ignited candle of the World of hu-
manity, may be devoted to the service
of all mankind, may give up your rest
and comfort, so that ye may become
the cause of the tranquillity of the
World of creation.
Such is my hope for you and I trust
that ye may become the cause of my joy
and gladness in the Kingdom of God.
I have sent your letter to Persia that
from that country the Bahai children
may write you an answer.
Upon ye be Baha-el-Abhal

ELIZABETH HERLITZ
To the maid-servant of God, Mrs. Eliza-
beth Herlitz, Chicago, 
her be El-Abha!
Is God 
thou Who art enkindled with the fire
of the love of God 1
Thy letter was received. Thy glad-
ness made me happy that, praise be to
God, that torch has been lit and the
chamber of thy heart and soul illumined
and resplendent. Do not consider thy
capacity and Worth. Turn thy face to
the Abha Kingdom for that shower of
perpetual bounty causes flowers and
lilies to grow from stones, and that ray
from the Sun of Truth breeds a shining
diamond in a heart of stone.
Ever add to thy hope.and endeavor
that the supreme favor may be made
manifest and the glorious bounty be
made resplendent.
Convey my utmost love and kindness
to thy dear and respected husband.
Upon thee be Baha-el-Abha!
(Signed) ABDUL--BAHA ABBAS.
