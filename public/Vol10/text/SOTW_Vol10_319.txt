STAR OF THE 319
both of you may pass your days in the
utmost joy and fragrance and become
the cause of the promulgation of the
divine teachings.
Convey on behalf of Abdul-Baha to
thy respected Wife my wonderful Aloha
greetings, and say: "The kindness, the
training and the education extended to
prisoners is an exceedingly important
matter. As thou hast therefore exerted
an effort along that line and hast
awakened some of them, and hast been
the cause of the turning" of their faces
to the divine Kingdom, this praise-
worthy deed is highly acceptable. Per-
severe assuredly along this line. Con-
vey on my behalf to the two prisoners
at San Quentin the utmost kindness,
and tell them, "That prison in the sight
of the wise souls is the school of train-
ing and development. Ye must strive
with heart and soul that ye may become
famous in character and knowledge."
Upon thee and upon them be greeting
and praise!

OLL-IE JAMES VVATTS
J. E. GIL-LIGAN
To their honors, Messrs. Ollie James
Vllatts and J. E. Gilligan, through
Mrs. Louise R. Waite, Los Angeles,
them be greeting
and praise!
He Is God!
ye two servants of the Kingdom!
Your letter was received. It was
conducive evidence that, praise be to
God, ye have been freed from the dark-
ness of superstitions, have attained to
the center of Truth, have been emanci-
pated from the old imitations that in-
dicate antiquity of the world, and are
investigating Truth. This undoubtedly
is due to the bounty of God and is in-
dicative of the lordly bestowals.
Consider how the people of the world
are immersed in a sea of imitations,
they lack perception and hold fast to
What they hear. Although they have
been immersed for thousands of years
in the ocean of superstitions and have
acquired no results, yet they are still
sleeping.
Praise be to God, therefore, that your
inner sight has been opened, that ye
have discovered the Truth, and have
attained unto that which is the cause of
heavenly glory and everlasting life.
Upon you be greeting and praise!

BArni'o'LLnH El-Abha!
He Is God!
thou seeker of the Kingdom!
Thy letter was received. Thou hast
Written that am not worthy." Who
is Worthier than thee? Hadst thou not
been Worthy, thou Wouldst not have
turned to God and Wouldst not have
Wished to enter the Kingdom.
Thy worthiness has guided thee until
this blessing and bounty have encom-
passed thee.
Upon thee be Baha-E1-Abha!

PETE-R MAUS
To his honor, Mr. Peter Mans, Helena,
him be 
E1-Abha!
Is God!
thou faithful servant of God!
Thy letter diffused a musk-scented
perfunie--the perfume of the flowers
and fragrant herbs of the love of God.
The nostrils were perfumed and the
heart was gladdened, that, praise be to
God, that firm and steadfast soul has be-
come the cause of the illumination of
two other ones and has led them to the
