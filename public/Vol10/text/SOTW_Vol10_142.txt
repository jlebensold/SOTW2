The first Tablet received in Egypt after
the opening of the doors of
communication.
He is God!
To the believers of Egypt:
true friends! Separation from the
friends causes the burning of heart and
soul. Separation, distance and foreign-
ness are the cause of injury and loss,
especially as no fragrant messages, nor
a faithful messenger, nor courier, nor
post, nor information, nor news from
any source have been received, and the
mind has been deprived of comfort.
Life and spirit were in the utmost
sadness and grief until the conquering
army arrived in the Holy Land and
seized the reins of government from the
cruel ones, and overthrew the authority
of the tyrants, and quietness and safety
were assured. The leaders of the coun-
try and the army showed sympathy and
kindness, soothing every oppressed one;
the black cloud was dispersed and the
horizon of the political situation clear-
ed. Believers and unbelievers were at
rest, and acquaintances and strangers
were playing cheerful melodies. Verily,
the darkness of injury and error was
uncovered by the light of equity and
justice, and the government put on the
garment of probity.
Praise be to God! By the bounty and
favor of the Blessed Perfection, amid
such great confusion and severe Whirl-
wind of calamities and severe oppres-
sion, these distressed ones Were in safety
and rest. No distress came upon any
one. There Was no trouble or sulfering
nor pain, until the Ark of the Cause of
God reached the shore of rescue from the
Whirlpool of danger. Now the ruling
government was overcome and all the
people of the country of every nation-
ality and tribe were made comfortable
on the couch of rest and safety.
His honor Mr. (Colonel) Storrs came
from Egypt and gave tidings of the
health and safety of all the believers.
I became very happy and grateful that,
praise be to God, the friends in Egypt
were also preserved and guarded.
Night and day we are remembering
you and sincerely praying for you and
the hope that we may meet. VVith heart
and soul I am longing for all the friends.
Upon them be the Glory of God!
