there must be education and freedom

earth.
'With the efforts of your President
the matter of universal peace has come
forth as expounded in the League of
Nations.
Through the favor of the True One,
and by the Word of God, I pray the
League of Nations shall soon become a
fact; that universal peace shall thence-
forth be established; that then the
brotherhood of man shall then be rec-
ognized, and that your honor and the
people of your country, may continue
a manifestation of their confirmation.
Praise be to God!
Love and benediction.

hotel Where I was guided. All the trains
of the Empire come and go from this
point and I see and hear them from my
window, but so long as I can follow o11ly
His guidance it must not matter where
I-am. I am only so thankful for the two
Wonderful years in America. My three
Bahai children have gathered here to
see me, and I feel now my Work is to
make the essence, which is planted in
them, so strong that through them the
divine torch will blaze in Japan.
Fuyo San is now Writing for a news-
paper and doing well. She wrote an
article about the Bahai Cause, and my
coming, for her paper and it is beauti-
ful. So this little "shrub," as Abdul-
Baha called her, is beginning to blos-
som, praise be to God!

VIOLA KLUGE
To the maid-servant of God, Miss Viola
Kluge, Chicago, Illinois--Upon her be
El-Abha!
Is God!
thou radiant child!
The letter thou hast Written in the
utmost sweetness has been perused. It
evidenced and indicated thy brilliant
capacity, thy wit and thy understanding.
The epistle was clear and consummate
and I therefore became hopeful of thee,
as thou attainest maturity, thou mayest
become a radiant, merciful and Godly
maiden, freed and sanctified from the
impurities of the World of nature, par-
taker and participator of the illumina-
tion of the divine reality and the cause
of the glorification of the World of hu-
manity.
Convey to thy father and thy mother
my greetings and my kindness and like-
wise to thy acquaintances.
His Holiness has en-
dured for your sake all these calamities
and trials, that the light of guidance
may illuminate your hearts. Abdul-
Baha has passed his days in confinement,
i11 exile and under a drawn sword; not
for a single hour did he ever entertain
the hope of deliverance until the present
time when an equitable government has
pitched its tent over these regions. Now
the means of assurance have been pro-
vided. In fine, all my intentions center
around this: that radiant children may
be trained by divine education and be-
come the blazing candles of the world of
humanity.
Upon thee a11d upon thy father a11d
mother be greetings and praise!
(Signed) ABBAS.
