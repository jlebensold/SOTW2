MR. AND MRS. GIFT
To their honor, Mr. and Mrs. Gift, Peo-
ria, Illinois~--Upon them be 
LLAH El-Abha!
He Is God!
ye two guiding souls!
Your letter was received. It was in-
dicative of your being devoted in the
path of the Kingdom and of your de-
tachment and self-effacement. Ye have
no Wish save the good pleasure of God,
and entertain no hope except in divine
Providence. Ye strive for the guidance
of souls and become the cause of the
illumination of hearts. This is a su-
preme bounty. Arise in gratitude to
it for its consequences and advantages
are innumerable. From among these
is the establishment of one 's remem-
brance and the attainment unto su-
preme bounty in the Abha Kingdom.
Convey on my behalf to the souls that
have been attracted by the divine teach-
ings, Mrs. Mr. 
and Mrs. greeting, love and
kindness.
Extend my greeting to Mrs. 
and say: "Be not grieved, be not
disconsolate, be not depressed and do
not lament, for this World is a mortal
abode and We shall all be transferred
from this World to another. Thy dear
daughter is accepted at the Threshold
of the Almighty, is immersed in the
ocean of pardon and forgiveness and is
drowned in a sea of light in the World
of mysteries."
Upon thee be Baha-El-Abha!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.

FLORA CLARK
To the maid-servant of God, Flora
Clark, care of the maid-servant of
God, Mrs. her be BAHA-
El-Abhal
He Is God!
thou dear maid-servant of God!
Thy letter was received. From its
contents prayer and supplication to the
Kingdom of God Were noted. No matter
how strenuously man may strive in this
World, ultimately no result Will be at-
tained. Naked has he stepped into this
World and naked shall he get out of it--
except if he turns unto God, supplicates
to His Kingdom, strives in His path,
serves the Almighty and acquires a pure
heart, a seeing eye, a responsive ear and
a spirit that is gladdened by the glad-
tidings of God. This has a result and
gives forth good fruit.
Otherwise man shall not gather any
advantage from life.
Praise thou God, that thou hast been
confirmed by such a bounty and hast
attained unto heavenly illumination.
Upon thee be Baha-El-Abha!
(Signed) ABDUL--BAHA ABBAS.
