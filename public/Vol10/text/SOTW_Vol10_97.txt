WORDS OF ABDUL-BAHA
"Great importance must be given to the development of the STAR or THE West. The
circle of its discussion must be widened; in its columns must be published the essential prob-
lems pertaining to the Bahai life in all its phases. Its contents must be_ so universal that
even the strangers may subscribe to it. Articles must be published, dealing with the uni-
versal principles of the Cause, the writers proving that this Cause takes a vital interest in
all the social and religious movements of the age and is conducive to the progress of the
world and its inhabitants. In short, the STAR or THE must promote the aspirations and
the ideals that will gather little by little around these general Tablets, bringing into the light
of day all the historical, religious and racial knowledge which will be of the utmost value to
thBh't h'?ll 'th ldOval WOT From Unveiling of the Dwme Plan.
