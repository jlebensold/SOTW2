STAR OF THE WEST
HARLAN FOSTER OBER
To his honor, Mr. Harlan Foster Ober,
Cambridge, Massachusetts--Upon him
be El-Abha!
He Is God!
thou who art firm in the Covenant!
Your detailed letter was received.
Praise be to God, that in the utmost en-
ergy, the friends of God have arisen to
promulgate heavenly teachings and are
self-sacrificing from every standpoint.
Verily, this>>is the sign of the confirma-
tions of the divine Kingdom Which, like
unto the sun, are manifest and evident.
The sending of teachers to different
parts is highly acceptable and praise-
Worthy. Act in accordance with the in-
structions previously sent.
Today the stirring power that exhibits
itself throughout all regions is thelpower
of the Covenant Which, like unto the
artery, beats and pulsates in the body
of the World. He Who is firmer in the
Covenant is more assisted, just as ye are
manifestly Witnessing how firm souls are
enkindled, attracted and confirmed.
Strive, therefore, day and night that
ye may cause the hearts to become firm
and resolute. The journey of teachers
to different parts is like unto the rays
of the sun Which radiate from a central
point to the surrounding regions and un-
doubtedly great illumination will be ob-
tained.
You had inquired concerning the fi-
nancial question of the Mashrekol-Azkar
and the expenses of the teachers. Ap-
propriation of the Mashrekol-Azkar
fund for purposes different from those
that pertain to the Temple is not per-
missable and conversely the teaching
fund is not to be used for Mashrekol-
Azkar purposes. Both should be used
in their own respective spheres. If it is
not done accordingly matters will be
completely upset. The future should be
taken into consideration and not the
present. I beg God that He may con-
firm you always in that which is the
cause of the gladness of your heart.
Concerning the STAR OF THE Wnsr,
the organ must be so promulgated in
America and Persia that at least its
necessary expenses may be provided.
Upon this point a letter shall be written
to Persia.
Upon thee be Baha-El-Abha!

EXECUTIVE BOARD OF BAHAI
TEMPLE UNITY
To the members of the Executive Board
of the Mashrekol-Azkar--Upon them
be El-Abha!
He Is God!
ye blessed souls!
Praise be to God, that ye have been
confirmed With such a supreme bounty
and have arisen with all your power in
the service of the Kingdom, which is no
other than service to the oneness of the
World of humanity.
The magnet attracts unto itself the
iron, While this promulgation of divine
teachings attracts heavenly confirma-
tion. Soon ye shall consider What a
profound effect it shall exert and What
a manifest sign it shall display.
I am greatly pleased with you, for day
and night ye concentrate your time upon
the commemoration of God, that ye seek
the divine good-pleasure, pray for
heavenly bounty and are firm in the
Covenant.
Upon ye be Baha-El-Abhal
