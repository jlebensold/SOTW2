Purposes and' Hopes of the Congress
Address by MR. HARLAN FOSTER OBER, of Boston, delivered at the opening of the
Bahai Congress at Hotel McAlpin, New York City, Saturday evening,
April 26th, 1919'. Stenographically reported.
MEMBERS and friends of this
great universal, penetrative and
powerful Bahai Movement: Because this
is the most epoch-making time that we
who have known of this Cause for years
have ever beheld, it Was deemed perti-
nent that we should suggest to you in a
general way in the very beginning some-
thing of the great things which are com-
ing out one by one during the coming
days.

call which has come through, from out

this time, because the conditions of the
World justify it and require it, because
the firmness and steadfastness of -the
friends of God have created a certain
capacity and because of the mercy of
God as expressed through the Covenant,
great plans are now to be unveiled which
are to energize and spiritualize this
Cause as never before. It is important
that in coming to and approaching these
great times our hearts and minds should
be as a blank page. We should be pre-
pared to receive the indelible imprints
