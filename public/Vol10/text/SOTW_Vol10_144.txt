ELL-A AND ELLAH A. RICE-WRAY
To the maid-servants of God, Ella and
Ellah A. Rice-"Tray, Detroit, Michi-
them be EL
Abha!
He is God!
ye two dear maid-servants of God!
Your letter dated December 4th, 1918,
was received. Praise be to God, His
Holiness my life be a
sacrifice to his friends-~hath expounded
and fully explained everything in the
manifest Book, hath not given any soul
the chance to be confounded, hath desig-
nated the Expounder of the Book that he
may fully explain and expose the mani-
fest teachings of God; and hath de-
volved the ordinances Which are not lit-
erally recorded in the Book, upon the
Universal House of Justice which, when-
ever it is organized, will engage in the
service of promulgating those ordinances
which are not manifestly mentioned.
Indeed, as thou hast Written, the
trials are severe. I, however, entertain
the hope that as the winds of tests Wax
more severe, the friends of God will
exhibit and assert more firmness and
steadfastness; that souls will be assisted
through the confirmation of the Abha
Kingdom and will conquer and quench
the uproar of self and desire
which is nothing but the world of nature
to which man is enslaved and from which
he can be emancipated only through the
power of God.
Concerning the effect of translation,
it is evident that it is not as effective
as the original. For instance, the Tab-
lets of His Holiness which
have been translated from Persian or
Arabic, the original text exerts a wonder-
ful power, while translation may produce
certain effect but cannot be measured
with the original. The delicacy, smooth-
ness and sweeimess of the Wo1*ds of His
Holiness are beyond any
human conception. It is, however, con-
ditioned upon one's knowledge of Per-
sian and Arabic.
Convey greetings to all the friends.
Upon thee be greeting and praise!

To his honor Mr. Remey, care of his
honor Mr. ltoy Wilhelm, New York
City~Upon him be El-
Abha!
Is God!
my dear son!
Numerous letters have been received
from you and their contents have all
been conducive to happiness. Praise
be to God, thou art confirmed in service
to the Kingdom art promulgating divine
teachings, art raising the call of the
oneness of mankind, art detaching the
souls from ignorant racial prejudices, art
summoning them to the investigation of
truth, art showing forth unto them the
light of guidance and art offering them
the chalice of the wine of the love of
God. This blessed purpose of thine is
the magnet of the confirmations of the
Abha Kingdom.
Rest thou assured and engage with
Mr. John Bassett in service to the King-
dom of God throughout the same south-
ern states. This is what is required at
present. Later on, undertake a tour to
the north of America and after that thy
course of action and that of Mr. John
Bassett shall be determined.
Convey, on my behalf, the utmost love
and kindness to Miss Margaret Klebbs
and say: "The people of the Supreme
admire your work that, praise be to God,
you are firm in the Covenant and Testa-
ment, and are serving the Kingdom of
God."
Upon thee be El-Abha!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
