"We desire but the good of the ld
wor and the
happiness of the nations; that all nations shall
bec 
ome one 1n fa1th and all men as brothers;
that the bonds of affection and unity between
the sons of men shall be strengthened that
diversity of religion shall cease and d'ff 
1 erences
of race be annulled. So it shall be; these fruit-
less st 'f 
r1 es, these rulnous wars shall pass away,
and the 'Most Great Peace' shall come."
